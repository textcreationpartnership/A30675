            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing Cuſtom ſeems to plead preſcription, and moſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Religious or Prophane, make bold to prefix ſome Great Name before their Writings, the better to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the World: I having theſe Papers by me, deſigned for the Preſs, and not being willing to break Cuſtom, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as much need of Protection as any, was not long in determining, but quickly made choice of your Ladyſhip, partly emboldned thereto, by your thankful Acceptance of a former Tract. My Ends in this Dedication is not to Intereſt you in any of my Errors, or Miſtakes; if any ſuch be found, let them be charged upon me; and I aſſure you, when they
<pb facs="tcp:40419:3"/> are Diſcovered, I ſhall be ready to throw the firſt ſtone at them; and were I Conſcious of any ſuch, I ſhould be loath to prefix yours, or my own Name before it: Neither is it that I think you need it, for I know not of any thing herein contained that you are Ignorant of; however it may not be un-uſeful to mind you of the things you know, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. Neither is it to tell the World how much I am ingaged to you, and to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy branches of your Family; for though I own your Courteſies thankfully, yet I know they were not beſtowed to this End, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould take Notice of them. But it is to let the World know, how High an Eſteem I have of you, and that I think you are fitter to Judge of Writings of this Nature than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, it being but a real Hiſtory of your own daily Practice. And alſo that I may point out unto the World (who are better led by Example, than by Rule) a Pattern for their Imitation, for in you they may ſee theſe Directions reduced into Practice, which otherwiſe they may think inpracticable: And alſo that the World may be convinc'd (who in this looſer Age is apt to think the contrary) that Gentility, and true Piety may Lodge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame Breaſt; and that our Age, as well as the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>John</hi> 1.13. doth afford ſome Elect Ladies, and that they may not think that Gentility and Debauchery are <hi>termius convertabiles;</hi> and he that owns one, muſt own the other alſo: but that there are
<pb facs="tcp:40419:3"/> ſome (and alas! too few) Noble, and Generous Spirits, that the Temptations of the Devil, nor the Allurements of the World, neither Riches, Honours, nor Pleaſures, can draw, or drive away from Chriſt. And, Madam, though thoſe that know you, take Notice of many Excellent Qualifications in you; as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Self-denial, Prudence, Temperance, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet real Holineſs, true Piety, and the power of Godlineſs, is the moſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Flower in your Garland, and the moſt Orient Jem that doth Adorn you; without which the reſt would not be ſo reſplendant; for by Sincerity Virtues are Adopted Graces. The World, I know, is as always it hath been, not only out of their way, but alſo out of their Wits in matters of Salvation, and ſtark blind in Spirituals, and only dote upon gilded Vanitie, and Worſhip a Golden Calf; yet the time is coming, their minds will change when they ſhall ſee all their Glory, how high ſoever it flye, vaniſh like Smoak before their Eyes into nothing. Now, they take them all to be Fools, or Mad men, that run Counter to the Courſes of the World, and the Corruptions of the Times; and moſt men had rather be Honourable, than Religious; Great, than Good. But when they have caſt up their Accounts at Death, they will find there was a miſtake in the Reckoning: They will then ſee Holineſs was the beſt Faſhion, though leſt worn; and that all the Pomp in the World was but gilded Rottenneſs, a dead
<pb facs="tcp:40419:4"/> Carkaſs ſtuff'd with Flower; and that at Death all the Gold in the <hi>Indies</hi> ſignifies no more than a handful of Dirt or Dung. The Time is at Hand (and long it cannot be) that one Dram of Grace will be worth a World; and one glymps of God's Favour worth a Thouſand Crowns and Kingdoms. Humility and Self-denial are two Soul-adorning Graces, though ſeldom ſeen worn in the Breaſt of great Perſons; they are the firſt Leſſon Taught in the School of Chriſt, though few ever take them out; they are Beautiful in Great men, as well as Poor: And ſubmiſſive Devotion in Religious Duties doth not wrong Majeſty it ſelf. Virtue is better than a Thouſand Eſcutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions; and 'tis true Nobility where God is the top of the Kin, and Religion lyes at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. 'Tis a greater Honour to be a Child of God, than to be Born of Princes; and to be Eſpouſed to Chriſt, ſpeaks more of Honour, and Happineſs, than the World can conferr. Riches of themſelves make not the Souls bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worſe; neither doth God think ever the better of men for Wealths ſake, except they take Chriſts Counſel, and make Friends with this Unrighteous <hi>Mammon,</hi> and by this means have their Riches made up into a Crown for their Head in the World to come. If theſe things ſeem Queſtionable to any, a little time may reſolve the doubt, when it will plainly appear, that a bare profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will ſerve no mans turn for Salvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. &amp; 25.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lamp of
<pb facs="tcp:40419:4"/> Profeſſion may Light a man to Death, never to Heaven. Madam, I Write not theſe things for your Inſtruction, but I had need to ſpeak them out, that others may hear. My Prayers to God are that you may go on in Honouring him, who hath Honoured you. And improve all for his Glory, from whom you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all; knowing you cannot do too much, or ſuffer too much for him, who hath done ſo much, and ſuffered ſo much for you; you cannot buy this Gold too dear, the World you may buy too dear, and moſt men do with the loſs of their Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> as to this unpoliſhed Piece, though I am conſcious to my ſelf of many wants, yet I hope a Will to do good is not wanting: He that did receive a Turtle for a Sacrifice, when a Lamb was wanting, and a little Goats Hair, when no Butter was to be had; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Widdows mite, when ſhe had no more, I hope will receive this when he knows I have no better; where but little is given, of him leſs will be required. The Subject I know is neceſſary, if not ſpoiled in the handling; though the Ring look dusk, yet the Diamond will ſparkle. Multiplicity of contrary Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and other Imployments, as moſt that know me can Witneſs, might, perhaps, have pleaded my Excuſe for Writing, (as indeed it did ſatisfie me for ſeveral Years) ſo I hope it will plead my Excuſe for coming forth in ſo homely a dreſs. When <hi>Paul</hi> beheld the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> his Spirit was moved;
<pb facs="tcp:40419:5"/> and when I beheld the formality of Profeſſors, no wonder, if, with <hi>Craſſus</hi> dumb Son, I ſpake, when I ſaw my Father wronged. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Objection I could think of that might come in againſt this my well-meant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I found none that ſaid it was impoſſible it ſhould do good, I am ſure none can juſtly Object it was not intended for good; thoſe that really deſire to lead a Holy life, I hope will own it; as for others, thoſe that have neither good word for God, nor for his ways, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect they ſhould have any for me; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my witneſs againſt them will be upon Record. Madam, if you have better at hand, you may beſtow this upon ſome wanting Soul, for whoſe ſake it was Written. I have not further to add, but deſire of God in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Times, when Atheiſm, Prophaneſs, Superſtition, and Debauchery are too much in Faſhion, that he will keep you and yours from the Temptations laid in your way; that you may ſhine as Stars of the firſt Magnitude to enlighten this dark Hemiſphere, that you may grow in Grace, as you grow in Years, and may be preſented blameleſs at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; that your Intereſt in Chriſt, and Title to Glory, may be cleared up, that when you come to dye, you may have nothing to do but to dye, and reſign up your Soul into the Hands of Chriſt; theſe are the deſires, and ſhall be the Prayers, of him who is,</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>CHriſtian Reader, I think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give thee ſome Account of this following Treatiſe; for in the beginning of it thou wilt find mention made of a former Treatiſe, which indeed is not yet Publiſhed; containing the Doctrine of Holy Walking. Now, although this was firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and firſt begun, and in Order of Nature ſhould have been the Firſt born; yet it fared with it as it did with <hi>Zarah,</hi> Gen. 38.28. This <hi>Pharez</hi> hath made a breach, and came out firſt; and, like <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſupplanted his Brother, and got the Birth-right; yet haply the other may not be ſtrangled in the Birth; if this prove not too Chargable in the keeping: Know then, when I firſt ſet upon the Work, I intended it to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five Parts, all in the ſame Method; the firſt containing, 1. An Introduction to the whole. 2. The Explication what Holy Walking
<pb facs="tcp:40419:6"/> implies. 3. The Reaſons why 'tis neceſſary. 4. The Objections againſt it Anſwered. 5. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to ſeveral ſorts that Live otherwiſe. 6. Some Conſiderations put to them. 7. Some groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes about Holineſs. 8. Marks of Holy Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 9. Devices of Satan to keep Men in ſin. 10. The Priviledges of the Godly. 11. Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications requiſite to an Holy Life. 12. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Conſiderations thereunto. 13. Hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the way to Heaven. And Laſtly, Helps and Directions. The Second Part is the preſent Book here preſented, of which I need give you no other Account. The Third contains Directions, 1. For the Thoughts. 2. For the Words. 3. For the Actions. 4. For the Affections. 5. For the Conſciences. 6. For Recreations. 7. For Apparel. 8. For Eating and Drinking. 9. For Redeeming Time. 10. For Buying and Selling. 11. For Company. 12. For Solitarineſs. 13. To bear Affliction well. 14. In a particular Calling. The Fourth contains a diſſwaſive, 1. From Sin in general. 2. From Pride. 3. Atheiſm. 4. Covetouſneſs. 5. Drunkenneſs. 6. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. 7. Swearing. 8. Lying. 9. Murder. 10. Idleneſs. 11. Apoſtacy. 12. Idolatry. 13. Hypocriſie. 14. Stealing. 15. Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The 5. and laſt contains Relative Duties, 1. Of the unmarried in reference to Marriage. 2. The mutual Duties of the Husband, and Wife. 3. The Husbands peculiar Duties. 4. The Wives Duties. 5. Parents Duties. 6. The Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Children. 7. Of Maſters. 8.

               </gap>ey will be uſeleſs: I know the World is full of Books, &amp; many that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain moſt, read leaſt; but ſhould we obſerve moſt mens Devotion and their Carriage in the World, we may Imagine, that Books, that reduce Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity into practice, and teach us our Duties to God and Man, are yet wanting, that is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently taught, that is not ſufficiently learnt; there are need of more Books that maintain the Vitals of Religion, in an Age, when almoſt all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is turned into a matter of Formality, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and little of the power of Godlineſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. I have not in this, neither do I intend in the other, brought you any new Lights, but to direct you in the good Old way, mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. which the Saints in former Ages have Walk'd in, and which will be proved to be the only way to Heaven, though of late there are many new attempts to find a better; but if any, but the way of Holineſs end in Happineſs, let me be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a falſe Prophet. Mens Brains were never better ſtufft, nor their Tongues ever more buſie, but their Hearts are empty, and their Hands are idle; never more talking of the way, and never leſs walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it: And if good words would ſave, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good Hearts, or good Works, or good Duties, never ſo many would go to Heaven as in our Age. Moſt mens knowledge floats in the Brain, and
<pb facs="tcp:40419:7"/> little ſinks, or ſoaks down into the Heart, or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Life, or Converſation; hence, like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have the Rickets, by reaſon of ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the Head grows too big for the Body. If a bare Profeſſion of Religion would ſerve turn for Salvation, (but it will not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. &amp; 25.1,2,3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the 14.) many would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for they can Number their Prayers as the Papiſt doth his Beads; but God doth not accept them by Number, but by Weight; <hi>He is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and will be Worſhipped in Spirit, and in Truth.</hi> A little Grace (I fear a little Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) makes a great ſhew in a Great man; the power of Godlineſs is for the moſt part left to the Poor, that are more willing to take pains, and have little to loſe. But whether God will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this, that thoſe to whom he hath given moſt, ſhould do leaſt, is a Queſtion ſhould be thought of. A bare Profeſſion makes many a man have a high Conceit of himſelf, but the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not a man to be Judge in his own Cauſe. My Deſign in the following Tract, is not to make the way to Heaven narrower, nor the Gate ſtraiter than it is; but to put you up ſome <hi>Way-marks,</hi> that you miſtake not the Road 'Tis not to make the Burden heavier than needs muſt; but to ſhew you what Burden 'tis that Chriſt would have you take up: 'Tis not to quench the ſmoaking Flax, or to break the bruiſed Reed, but to awaken the dull and drowſie Formaliſt, and to ſet him on fire that was quite out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſhew the miſtakes of thoſe that think the way to Heaven to be ſo broad, that a whole Pariſh may go abreast, and a reeling
<pb facs="tcp:40419:7"/> Drunkard can hardly ſtep aſide; and the Gate ſo wide, that a Man may enter, not only with the World, but with a load of Sins alſo on his back; and that they may uſe their Prayers, as others do their Charms, with good Succeſs, though they underſtand them not; but God is not much taken with a little Lip labour, when the Heart is abſent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.26. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.32. The Time is coming Men will be convinc'd to purpoſe, that their Soul was their chiefeſt Jewel; that Heaven was no Fable, and Hell no Scare-Crow, nor Eternity no Melancholy Fancy; and that God ſpake in Earneſt what they took in Jeſt: That Sin is no matter of Sport, and the Service of God no Formal Complement: That thoſe were the Wiſeſt that made Proviſion for Eternity, and thoſe the verieſt Fools that fooled away their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Sold their Souls, as <hi>Eſau</hi> his Birth-right, for a Meſs of Pottage, or for that which was worſe, for a baſe Luſt, and laid out their money for that which is not Bread, and their Labour for that which profits not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. But the Time will come they will Repent the bargain. But to return, it may be Objected, this plain Diſcourſe is not ſuitable for this Learned Age, but the Sick Man deſires to have <hi>Medicum non Eloquentem ſed Saventem,</hi> and rather deſires to be Cured, than Courted. Thoſe that Sin in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> why ſhould they be reproved in <hi>Latine,</hi> but in plain words. Had I had better at Hand thou hadſt had it, and how it came to paſs I had no better, I can give thee this brief Account. When by Providence I was laid aſide as a broken
<pb facs="tcp:40419:8"/> Veſſel, and the Time was come that the <hi>Levites</hi> were ſent every one to his Field, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.10. and I not having that Proviſion made as many others had, and but little, if any thing left to maintain a numerous Family, I was forced to Fight againſt Poverty, almoſt to the neglect of my Study; ſo that I can ſay, with the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.34. (and many that knows me, may ſay as much for me) <hi>Theſe Hands miniſtred to my Neceſſity and thoſe that were with me:</hi> My Head being filled with other diſtracting Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and my Hands with other Imployments, that I had few ſpare hours (except by Night) to mind thoſe Studies, ſo that I hrought forth this, as a <hi>Bear</hi> doth her Whelps, a confuſed Lump, and had no time to lick it into Form. 'Tis a Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of unripe Fruits, blown down by the Wind of Worldly Diſtractions; yet miſtake not, had my time been more, and my Abilities greater, it ſhould have ſpoken plain <hi>Engliſh:</hi> I would not have hid any Fruit with Leaves, nor been a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> to the meaneſt Reader, nor have wrapt up my meaning in a Cloud. Reader, my Advice is, if thou findeſt Chriſt here, though not in ſoft Rayment, but as in his Infancy but meanly clad, yet reject him not; good Counſel in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> is not to be rejected; and a good Stomack will not reject good Meat, though not Modiſhly dreſt. If there be any thing here Offered, contrary to God's Word reject it, and ſo ſhall I when I know it; if not, rejecting of it will be a diſſowning God himſelf. If thou meet with (as I fear thou maiſt) ſome Tautoligies, or Repetitions, look
<pb facs="tcp:40419:8"/> upon it as the Fruit of broken Studies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Meditations. I have ſaid enough, and, perhaps, too much, and ſhall add no more, but wiſh that God, who hath inclined my Heart to Write it, may incline thine to Read and Practice it; and if thou haſt any benefit by it, I ſhall think my pains well beſtowed: This is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned deſire of him, who is</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in a former, Treatiſe handled the Doctrine of holy walking, and ſhewed the excellency and neceſſity of it, and given you Marks and Motives to perſwade you to it, and Directions in it, and anſwered the Objections that are made againſt it; I ſhall come now to treat of it in particular, and ſhew you how to demean your ſelves towards God, in the ſeveral parts of his Worſhip, wherein conſiſts the main, though not the whole of holy walking: And in every part of Gods worſhip, I ſhall give you Directions for the right perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But Reader, wilt thou reſolve to follow thoſe Directions? For otherwiſe 'tis in vain for me to write, or thee to read, it will but make thee ſin with a Candle in thy hand, What good will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40419:10"/> Meat do if not eaten and digeſted? Or Phyſick do if not taken? Or a Plaiſter if not applyed? So what good will Directions do, if not followed? It is not enough to read thy duty, but thou muſt do it, nay 'tis not enough to do it, but thou muſt do it well: Thoſe that worſhip God, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth, 'tis not a little lip la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or knee ſervice will ſerve his turn without the Heart, and the Heart rightly qualified, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards it not, he will have none of it, for <hi>there is none holy as the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam, 22. And the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of none into his ſervice that are not holy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. <hi>I will be ſanctifyed by thoſe that draw near to me, Lev.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> He is a living God, and requires living Sacrifice, and will not take up with a dead heart: There muſt be a principle of life in thee, or thou art nor fit to come into his preſence, for he is a conſuming fire unto his Enemies, there muſt be Regeneration, or there can be no Salvation, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. And <hi>without faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe him.</hi> Heb. 11.6. 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to worſhip him, but it muſt be in ſincerity and truth, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.14 What is thy Reſolution, wilt thou worſhip him or wilt thou not? there are few in plain words will deny it, but in actions they do, either they worſhip him not at all, or give him that he requires not, or do it in a manner he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not: They are like the Son that ſaid to his Father, <hi>I go Sir, but went not,</hi> Mat. 21.30. But ſhall we take it for granted that thou wilt worſhip him? but wilt thou do it in truth and ſincerity? o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe God will not regard it. I fear we may ſay of many, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> of <hi>Iſrael Joſh.</hi> 24.19. <hi>You cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is an holy God,</hi> but is it your Reſolution as theirs was in the verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40419:10"/> 
                     <hi>Nay, but we will ſerve the Lord,</hi> and that you will chooſe the Lord to ſerve him, conſider what you do, you muſt take him to be your God, and be willing to have your Souls cleanſed from all your ſins, and muſt be willing to take the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel, to be your Lord and Husband, and be as willing to be ruled by him, as ſaved by him, and muſt reſolve to obey his Laws, and do his will, and live in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe ſpiritual duties he requires at at thy hand. Yea, thou muſt have a ſetled Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to cleave to Chriſt, and obey him even in the moſt deſpiſed, diſgraceful, dangerous, difficult and coſtly part of duty: Though it be to the loſs of thy worldly enjoyments, yea, and life it ſelf: I know many would pick of chooſe their duties, this they would do, but that they would not; they ſcum of the Fat and ſweet of duty, but leave that which is difficult, or dangerous, but God will have no ſuch Servants: obey him thou muſt, though thy Father, Mother, and all thy Friends become thine Enemies upon the account; yea, in ſome caſes thou muſt not only leave, but hate Father and Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, thy own life for his ſake yea, though thou looſe thy credit and eſteem in the World, and be made a ſcorn and a reproach for his ſake; though thou looſe thy pleaſure, and never ſee merry day whilſt thou liveſt; though it endanger thy Eſtate, and bring thee to Poverty; though thou looſe thy Liberty, and be caſt into a Priſon; yea, though thou looſe thy life, and be brought to a Stake to ſuffer; yea, though thou ſeeſt few or none walk that ſame way with thee: <hi>Noah</hi> muſt obey God, though the whole World diſobey him; yea, thou muſt obey him, though his commands be never
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40419:11"/> ſo contrary to thy carnal intereſt, or never ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to fleſh and blood, and though they are never ſo hard or difficult, or dangerous, or coſtly, before ever thou take upon thee the profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſit down firſt and reckon the charges, leſt like many thou begin to build, and be unable to finiſh it; and not like many, put their hands to the Plow, and then look back: or like the ſtony ground when perſecution ariſeth, preſently are offended: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to give him thy heart with thy hand, or he will have none of thee, he knows the heart, and trie the reins, and thou canſt not deceive him with a diſſembling ſhew, when <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> offered ſtrange fire, he ſlew them. When <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> played the Hypocrite, he ſtruck them dead. Cleanſe thy heart therefore if thou wilt ſerve him, and ſerve him thou muſt, or do worſe: Thou canſt never err on that hand, in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him too well; he deſerves more and better than thou canſt give him, his wages will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thy work: now that I may prevail with thee to ſerve God, take theſe following Motives.</p>

He made us, and therefore hath moſt right to us; He made us for his ſervice, and therefore 'tis all the reaſon in the World that we ſhould ſerve him; for who is the Pot, but the Potters? and this is the ſervice he requires of us, to worſhip him according to his will, and praiſe him for his benefits, this is all he requires at our hands, even this Tribute of praiſe, and ſhall we be ſo ingrateful to our great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40419:11"/> to deny him this? Nay, we are his alſo by right of Redemption, for we had ſold our ſelves unto ſlavery, even to Sathan, and were become Bond-ſlaves to this helliſh <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who exerciſed more cruelty to our Souls, than ever <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did to the Bodies of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and in the ſlavery had remained for ever, had not God ſent his own Son to ranſome us with the loſs of his life, and the ſhedding of his pretious blood: <hi>Satan</hi> was the ſtrong man armed that kept his houſe in peace, till Chriſt a ſtronger than he diſarmed him, and took away his weapons wherein he boaſted. And now <hi>being bought with a price, we ſhould glorifie God with our Bodies, and with our Souls which are Gods.</hi> The end he aimed at in our Redemption, was his own glory as well as our liberty; and this he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from our hands, is, <hi>we being delivered from the fear of our Enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the days of our Lives,</hi> Luk. 2.74,75. Nay, we are alſo his by Covenant, under our Hand and Seal in our Baptiſme, we were dedicated to his ſervice, which Covenant ſince we have often ratified at the Sacrament of the Supper, and how can we deny our own act and deed? <hi>He is our Lord, and we ſhould worſhip him,</hi> Pſal, 45.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Now that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice is required of us is evident, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon ſpeaks as much, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.36. <hi>You ſhall not fear other Gods, nor bow your ſelves to them, nor ſerve them, nor ſacrifice to them, but the Lord who brought you out of the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>with great power, and a ſtretched out arm, him ſhall ye fear, ond him ſhall ye worſhip, and to him you ſhall do ſacrifice, and his ſtatutes, and his ordinances ye ſhall obſerve.</hi> Exod. 34.4. <hi>You
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40419:12"/> ſhall worſhip no other God but him, the like we have,</hi> Exod. 20.50. 1 Chron. 16.29. <hi>Give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord the glory due unto his Name, bring an Offering and an Oblation before him, worſhip him in the beauty of holineſs.</hi> Yea, Chriſt himſelf preacheth this doctrine, when the Divil tempted him to fall down and worſhip him; he anſwered, <hi>It is written thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Mat. 4.8. Yea, he directs us with what worſhip to worſhip him, <hi>John</hi> 4.23,24. <hi>The true worſhippers worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth, God is a Spirit, and thoſe that worſhip him, must worſhip him in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> and of this ſpiritual worſhip we may alſo read, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. Or will you hear the counſel of an Angel from Heaven, you have it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>Worſhip God,</hi> yea, this is the practice of the Angels, the work they do, and the work that the Angels, and gloryfied Saints ſhall do through all Eternity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. But what are Teſtimonies in ſo plain a caſe? few deny it, though few pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it as they ought, we might bring you exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from the beginning of the World to this day, of the godly in all Ages that have thus worſhipped, thus ſerved God, though many in all Ages, the more is the pity, have given that to the Divel, which is due to God alone; many have ſacrificed to Devils, <hi>and worſhiped and ſerved the Creature more than the Creator bleſsed for ever,</hi> Rom. 1.25. To prove that 'tis ſo, now, I need not inſtance in the <hi>Indians,</hi> that know no better, nor in the Papiſts that worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, and the works of their own hands, which iS forbidden, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.8. And ſwear by God and our Lady, as the <hi>Iſraelites did by God and Malchon,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40419:12"/> ſome other Mediators with Chriſt, but how many may we find ſerve the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh; though they covenanted to fight againſt them in their Baptiſm: if the Devil bid them ſweaty they will ſwear, if he bid them be drunk, they will be drunk; or if he bid them lye, or ſteal, or decieve, they will obey; let God ſay what he will to the contrary: Yea, though he ſet them upon the hardeſt, difficulteſt, dangerous work they will do it, though they venture life and limb in his ſervice; but let them at the end brag of their wages, that ſo love the work, but as with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24.14. <hi>In the way which men call Hereſie, ſo worſhip the God of your Fathers.</hi>

Wouldſt thou have one that is able to defend thee, and ſee that thou art not wronged? Here is Omnipotency it ſelf, if he ſet thee on work he can bear thee out. The Devil may ſhake his chain, and wicked Men may gnaſh their teeth at thee, hurt thee they cannot, all the powers of darkneſs can do thee no wrong. The Devil could not touch one of <hi>Jobs</hi> cattel without Commiſſion ſealed in Heaven; and if thou faithfully ſerve him, he will never grant any Commiſſion, but what ſhall be for thy good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. He is <hi>El Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dai,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40419:13"/> a God able to deſtroy, or remove all rubs out of his way: But no other Maſter can defend thee againſt him, Or wouldſt thou have a merciful, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or tender hearted Maſter? the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford thee ſuch another; never was there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father, or tender hearted Mother, more careful over their only child, than God is over all his ſervants, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhall not have compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Son of her Womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee ſaith the Lord. Behold I have engraven thee upon the palms of my hand thy walls are continually before me.</hi> Never was Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith more careful of his gold, that it ſhall not be in the Furnace longer than need is, than God is of his People, they ſhall be no longer in the Furnace of affliction, then neceſſity requires, till their droſs is conſumed, and they refined: Or wouldſt thou ſerve a wiſe Maſter? One able to direct thee and inſtruct thee in thy work? One able to counſel thee what to do, and what to forbear? Here is one that is Wiſdom it ſelf, yea the Fountain of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of God ſaith the Apoſtle is wiſer than the wiſdom of Man.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. That is that which in the eyes of the World is fooliſhneſs, he can over wit, and over work all his Enemies, and thou canſt not be in ſuch a ſtrait, but he can help thee, nor in ſo much danger but he can deliver thee, as he did <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the Red Sea; <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions Den, the three Children out of the fiery Furnace, <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the Whales belly, and <hi>Peter</hi> out of Priſon. Or wouldſt thou ſerve a Maſter that is faithful and juſt, that will make good his word, and fulfil his promiſe? God is ſuch a one, he is more faithful than the Sun and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40419:13"/> Moon in their courſes, <hi>Hath he ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it, hath he ſpoken it, and ſhall he not bring it to paſs?</hi> Heaven and Earth ſhall fail, before one tittle of his word ſhall fail, till all be fulfilled. The experience of five Thouſand years cannot produce one example when God hath falſified his word. Or wouldſt thou ſerve ſome honorable Perſon, God hath the higheſt titles of honor, he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Princes, he is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Caſtles of a thouſand hills are his, yea, all the Beaſts of the Forreſts, all Nations to him are but as a drop of a Bucket, or the ſmall duſt of the Ballance. Never fear then, he is able to pay thee thy wages. <hi>David</hi> delighted more in being his ſervant, than in being King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loſt by his ſervice; wouldſt thou ſerve one that is loving and kind? why he is love it ſelf, ſee one act of his love, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believed in him ſhould not dye, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi> See the love of the Father in giving, and the love of the Son in dying; and wouldſt thou ſerve a patient Maſter?

The Devil is thy ſworn Enemy, and ſeeks thy Soul to deſtroy it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. He offers much indeed, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay thee, he hath nothing of his own, but his vitious qualities; what he ſhews thee is but what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40419:14"/> he baits his hook with, or with the Fowler his ſnares, not to feed thee, but to entrap thee; he hunts for thy Soul like a blood hound, and nothing will ſerve him but thy diſhonor. The World alſo will deceive thee, and promiſe pleaſure, and pay pain, it will never pay thee thy wages, and wilt forſake ſuch a Maſter as God is, and commit thy ſelf to ſuch known cheats?

And is not this a pleaſant and delightful du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and is it not reaſonable that we ſhould love God our great Benefactor, in whom we live, and move, and have our being; and our Brethren that are of the ſame fleſh and blood: To believe in him alſo is our duty, and is it not reaſonable when we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove that ever he deceived any. To praiſe him alſo is our work, this is an Angelical work, fit for Heaven, and Heaven-born Souls, and will be the work of Eternity, where Saints and Angels ſhall make up one quire, to Trumpet out the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God: To hold communion with him, this is a Chriſtians happineſs here, and to converſe with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40419:14"/> him in Glory is Heaven it ſelf. 'Tis no wonder then that the Service of God is called perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Servants are called his Free-men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. 'Tis no wonder that Chriſt tells us, <hi>his Yoak is eaſie, and his Burthen is light,</hi> Mat. 11.30. for all thoſe that feel it find it ſo, through Divine Aſſiſtance. I know, to a Carnal Heart, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified Soul it appears otherwiſe; but 'tis the Galls, Sores, and Putrified Corruption of Nature that makes it ſo; the eaſieſt Yoak upon a galled Neck ſeems uneaſie: Learn but this one Leſſon, get but this one Qualification, to love God above all, and all the reſt will prove eaſie; Love makes Labour light: the Love of Chriſt conſtrained the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and made him willing, not only to be bound, but to dye for Chriſt; then Prayer would be no difficult Duty, for who would not willingly go to him he Loves, and pour out his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts into his Boſom? when he knows he ſhall have a ſupply, and hath ſuch promiſes as thoſe; <hi>ask, and you ſhall have; ſeek, and you ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened to you,</hi> Pſal. 50.15. Praiſe alſo then will be a delightful Duty; how apt are we to Commend thoſe we Love, and ſpeak well of them? Hence it is, that the Saints and Angels in Heaven are not weary of this work, even to Eternity; Communion with God is no toylful, but delightful Duty, for Union, and Communion with God is the Souls Happineſs; nay, 'tis here a Heaven upon Earth, and will be their Heaven for ever, which is ſweet here, though much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted; what will it be then when we enjoy him Face to Face, and ſee him as he is? here it fills the Heart full of ſuch Joy, <hi>as no Stranger ſhall ever meddle with,</hi> Prov. 14.10. I know the world brags
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40419:15"/> of their pleaſures in the Devils Service, and are afraid to be Chriſtians for fear of loſing them, but this is but one of the Devils Lime-twigs, in which he fetters them, and one of the deceits of the Father of Lyes: a true Chriſtian finds by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience more true Joy, more raviſhing delight in one days Communion with Chriſt, than ever he did in the Service of ſin; for, <hi>in the midſt of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſinners heart is ſorrowful, and the end of that mirth is Heavineſs.</hi> But a Believer may <hi>eat his Meat with Joy, and drink his Wine with a merry Heart, for God accepteth his Work,</hi> Eccl. 9.7. <hi>And with joy they can draw waters out of theſe Wells of Salvation,</hi> Iſa. 12.3. <hi>Yea, ſhout for joy if he be of an upright Heart,</hi> Pſal. 32.11. There is none in the world that has more true Cauſe of Joy than they have; here they are under the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God, and are ſure to want nothing that is good; and when this Earthly Tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, they have a Kingdom prepared for them. But what is the Devils work which he imploys his Servants about? 'Tis the baſeſt drudgery, the moſt ſervile Slavery, the moſt ſordid, unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Dangerous work in the world; he ſets them to hate God, who is the chiefeſt good, to hold up weapons of defiance againſt him, from whom they have their Life and Breath, and Being; to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his Name, abuſe his Creatures, break his Commandments, Perſecute his Children, both by Hand and Tongue; pluck the Stars out of his Right Hand, the Signet of his Finger, the Apple of his Eye, his Jewels, thoſe whom his Soul Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; yea, to de-throne him, and ſet up the Devil in his place; yea, he makes them ſo mad upon it, that they will venture Life and Limb in the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;

                  <p>HAving in the fore-going Treatiſe, ſhewed you the Excellency, Neceſſity and Benefits of an Holy Life; and the deadly danger of all unholy Courſe; I hope many of you are reſolved to alter that courſe of life: you have too long already lived in; and will begin to queſtion what ſhall we do to be ſaved? To this end in this part, I ſhall point out ſome neceſſary duties, which every Chriſtian is bound to perform, and lay down ſome directions by them for the right performance of them.</p>
                  <p>Now my deſire is, that you would reſolve to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40419:22"/> practice what out of Gods word I ſhall prove to be your duty; otherwiſe to what end ſhall I write them, or you read them: what ſay ſay you, will you do it, or will you not? 'tis not a ſlight buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither will a ſlight reſolution ſerve your turn; you will meet with many Racks in the way, and therefore had need to be well grounded; with many ſtorms of temptations, and therefore had need to lay a good foundation; you have ſpent too much time already in the ſervice of Sin and Satan, and 'tis pity you ſhould any longer ſerve ſo bad a Maſter: and now God gives you a call unto his ſervice; methinks it ſhould be no hard queſtion to reſolve, neither need you any great time to conſider, whether God or the Devil be the beſt Maſter? whether Holyneſs or Sin be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter work? whether Heaven or Hell be the better wages? whether the Tranſitory Pleaſures of Sin, or the endleſs joyes of Heaven be more deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? haſt thou need of much time to conſider of this buſineſs? if thou yet ſtand at a ſtay, let me put in ſomthing that may turn the Scales: conſider to whom thou art moſt engaged, to God or Satan? art not thou Gods by right of Creation? he made thee of nothing, and whoſe is the Pot, but the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers? he made thee a Rational Creature, when he might have made thee a Brute Beaſt; a Toad or a Serpent, or the moſt deſpicable Worm that crawls under thy feet, and is it not he that maintains thee at his own Coſt and Charges? thou haſt not Food to eat, or Drink to drink, or Clothes to put on, but what he gives thee; neither Health nor Strength, Limbs nor Senſes, Life nor Breath, but from him; 'tis his Corn and his Wine, that feeds thee, 'tis his Wool and his Flax that clothes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40419:22"/> thee; 'tis his Silver and his Gold that makes thee Rich, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.5. And is it yet a Queſtion, who ſhould be thy Maſter? Haſt any better Friend, or greater Benefactor? Nay, further; thou art his alſo by right of Redemption; when thou ſoldeſt thy ſelf to be a Slave to Satan, did not he buy thee by his precious Blood, out of that Helliſh Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Did not he loſe his Life for thy Ranſom? Did not he lay down his Life to free thee from the guilt of ſin, and from the filth of ſin, and from the puniſhment due for ſin, from the wrath of God, the Curſe of the Law, the Slavery of Satan, and from everlaſting damnation? and haſt thou yet a better Friend to truſt to? The work God ſets thee about is wages as well as work; 'tis equal, 'tis reaſonable, 'tis honourable; his Yoak is eaſie, and his burthen light: The wages alſo differs; the one gives everlaſting Happineſs, the other endleſs miſery: and canſt not yet determine who ſhall be thy Maſter? Conſider then, what God minds in theſe his Commands; is it his own benefit, or thine? What profit is he like to have by thy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Or what damage by thy Diſobedience? Alas! thou art ſo far below him, thou canſt neither do him good or hurt: All the benefit or damage redounds to thy own Soul. Conſider alſo, what the Devil minds; doubtleſs, thy Ruine: <hi>He goes about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. And art not yet determined who ſhall be thy Maſter? Conſider then, whether ever thou kneweſt one Man that ever was made Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py by following a ſinful Courſe of Life: Or ever thou kneweſt one Man made miſerable by God's Service, or an Holy Courſe of Life. And now, if thou haſt reaſon, make uſe of it; and I doubt not,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40419:23"/> if thou wouldſt be brought to conſideration, thou wouldſt ſoon reſolve. I ſhall at preſent take it for granted, and ſhall proceed; firſt, to give you ſome general Directions to be obſerved in all duties; and then deſcend to ſome particular duties unto God, and give Directions for theſe alſo: the general are theſe that follow.</p>

                     </label> In all the Duties thou performeſt to God or Man, ſee that thou haſt a Divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for it out of the Word of God; that which he Commands, is our Duty; and what he forbids, is our ſin if we do it; where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion; and where 'tis no Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Duty, there thou canſt expect no Bleſſing; yet many Men are apt to invent ways for God's Worſhip, as if the Scripture were difficult; and, with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Teach for Doctrines, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men; they ſet up their Poſts by God's Poſt, and their <hi>Dagon</hi> by God's Ark, but it will never ſtand; they take much pains, and be at much coſt in the Worſhip of their own deviſing, but they will loſe their Labour; and when they come for their Reward, God will ask them, who required theſe things at their hands? When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art preſt unto a Duty, enquire whether God Command it, or at leaſt, whether it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to his Word, if not, reject it; we muſt not Worſhip God after Mens invention, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Traditions, contrary to his revealed Will. God hath left us work enough to do, we need not invent more. We read indeed of ſome Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that fained themſelves gods, and then patcht up a kind of Idolatrous Worſhip to theſe gods; thus <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts cut and wounded themſelves till the blood guſhed out, not much unlike to our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40419:23"/> whippings: Some alſo poured out Drink-Offerings to the Queen of Heaven, and baked Cakes for her, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. Yea, ſome of them Offered their Children to <hi>Molech,</hi> and made them paſs through the Fire; yet all this Labour was loſt, yea, worſe than loſt, it became their ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to a ſtrange god. In like manner, many Worſhip the true God in a falſe manner, by giving him ſuch Worſhip he never Commanded, neither ever came it into his mind. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a ſufficient Rule for Worſhip, where all the material parts of Worſhip are preſcribed; only ſome neceſſary Circumſtances are left to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence to determine, as the Time, and Place, and other ſuch like, which may be altered according to the preſent occaſion; yet we read in Scripture of Voluntary Humility, and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Angels, but God doth not allow of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly err in thruſting upon us thoſe new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, needleſs Ceremonies, ſuch as God never made, neither ever gave power to Man to intrude into his worſhip; yea, alſo they err in adding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things as Fundamentals, which are errors of their own deviſing, ſuch as their five added Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their private Maſs, Communicating in our kind, propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sick and dead, Prayers to Saints departed, and to Angels, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Crucifixes, Popes Pardons, Indulgences, Pilgrimages, and many more; but theſe wanting Authority, are not to be heeded by us; yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us alſo we have too many Popiſh Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, received by Traditions, which God hath never warranted, and therefore we ought not to obſerve them. But in all thy Duties, whether it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40419:24"/> be an Act of Divine worſhip, or any Duty to thy Neighbour, ſearch the Scriptures, if it be not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Rule, own it not: See what need Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have of knowledge to know what is ſin, and what is Duty; what is Commanded, and what forbidden.</p>

                     </label> When thou knoweſt thy Duty, and haſt a Divine Command for it, delay not, but ſet upon it; many undo themſelves by delays, they think to do that hereafter, which they never Live to do; practice is the Life of all. Set upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe Duties which God requires at thy Hands; take them as they lye, and do not pick and chuſe. 'Tis the practice of ſome Men, and thoſe of no ſmall note, for Religion, to pick and chuſe their Duties; this they will do, and this they will not do; they ſcum off the Fat and ſweet of Duty, and leave the difficult, dangerous, coſtly part of Duty undone; but this is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, neither will it evidence any one to be a Chriſtian indeed: Many, eſpecially great ones, run on with this miſtake; for a little Grace makes a great ſhew in a great Man, yea, oft-times the ſhew is taken for the Subſtance; many will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch Duties as are in Credit in the world, and like to coſt them but a little, which yet refuſe ſelf-denying, difficult or dangerous Duties. They will hear, and read, and confer, and, perhaps, pray in their Families, and ſome other ſuch like External parts of worſhip; and if God will be pleaſed with theſe, and Heaven will be had upon ſuch terms, they will have it: but if he require ſelf denyal duties, or thoſe which croſs their own Intereſt, if they muſt take up the Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and deny themſelves, hate and forſake
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40419:24"/> Father or Mother, Wife or Children, Lands or Livings, Pleaſure or Honour, Liberty or Life, for his ſake; they will not buy Heaven at ſo dear a rate. But God is reſolved he will abate nothing, and they are reſolved they will bid no more; and ſo they part. But hath not the ſame God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the one as well as the other? And hath he not wiſdom enough to know which is the beſt, and neareſt way to Heaven? Or would he willingly torment his Creatures, and put his Servants to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Troubles? Can theſe Men think to find out a nearer way to Heaven than God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed? Or that they ſhall ever come there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge, without the Qualifications he requires. Surely they are much miſtaken; yet how ordinary is it even for Profeſſors themſelves to ſtudy Arguments for ſin, and againſt duty, when the one ſuits with their Carnal Intereſt, and the other croſſes it. But Chriſtians that have taken Chriſt upon his own terms, and are delivered from the power of ſin and Satan, think they can never do enough for Chriſt. They are always queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what ſhall I do for him, that hath done ſo much for me? <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> Pſal. 118.12. 'Tis the very end why we are delivered from our Enemies, <hi>to ſerve God in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the days of our Lives,</hi> Luke 1.74,75. 'Tis the mark of thoſe that Love God, to keep his Commandments, <hi>John</hi> 14.15. When others perform duties only in Subſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to their own Carnal Intereſts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only own that part and duty that ſuits with their deſigns, as <hi>Jehu,</hi> in his Reformation of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and ſet up their Staff, and ſay, hitherto will I go, and no further; then a godly Man that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40419:25"/> makes the enjoyment of God his ultimate end and aim, will, like <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Lyons Den, or the three Children to the Fiery Furnace, before they will either neglect known duties, or commit known ſins: Others are forward in the cheap part, but backward in the coſtly part of duty; and the Devil might alſo buy their Profeſſion it ſelf out of their Hands; many that will hear, and read, and pray, becauſe it coſts them little, yet will hardly be perſwaded to be Charitable to the Poor, and Liberal to Pious Uſes, becauſe 'tis coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or to forgive Injuries, love Enemies, make Reſtitution of ill gotten Goods; venture their Eſtates, Lives, or Liberty, when the Cauſe of God requires it; then they cry out, with <hi>Naaman, the Lord be merciful to me in this thing:</hi> but God will abate nothing of his price, he will have Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obedience, or he will own none at all.</p>

Then hold on in a conſtant courſe of Duty; 'tis not enongh to begin well, but thou muſt hold out well: The ſame Reaſon that perſwaded thee to enter into ſuch a Courſe of Duty at the firſt, may perſwade thee to hold out to the end; there is the ſame ground for the one, as for the other: If it be becauſe ſtorms ariſe, Troubles and Perſecutions look thee in the Face, this might have been fore-ſeen; thou ſhouldſt have ſate down firſt, and reckoned the Charges; Chriſt told thee before, <hi>Through many Tribulations we muſt come to Heaven.</hi> He that is now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Chriſt and his Croſs of Service, the time is coming, Chriſt will be aſhamed of him: Thou muſt follow him through thick and thin; through good Report, and evil Report, or thou art like

Many Promiſes are made to thoſe that overcome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.11.17.26. &amp; 3.5.12.21. There are many, that in a day of Goſpel Proſperity, cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> unto Chriſt; but when ſtorms are up, then cry, <hi>Crucifie him.</hi> This Age gives too full a Teſtimony to this Truth. But thoſe that are Faithful to God will be conſtant in his Service, what danger ſoever looks them in the Face. Many are like to Weather-Cocks, turn with every Wind; or like a Ship without Ballaſt, are toſſed with every Storm: But a ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is like a Ship in the Harbour, that hath a ſure and ſtedfaſt Rock to Anchor upon. Many are like the Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> good in a good Conjunction, and bad with the bad: Or like <hi>Proteus,</hi> that can turn themſelves into any ſhape for Advantage; but a true Chriſtian gives this for his Motto, <hi>Semper idem,</hi> always the ſame; the change of Times, the change of Company, the change of Religion, makes no change in him; he knows God changes not: Poverty and Proſperity are God's trying Times, wherein may be diſcovered what is in the Heart; <hi>Hazael,</hi> when a mean Man, never thought ſo much evil had been in his Heart, as appeared to be there when he was Advanced. The ſtony
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40419:26"/> ground did not at firſt appear to be ſo deceitful, as indeed it proved. But Holy <hi>Job</hi> was the ſame on the dung-hill, as on the Throne; in Adverſity, as in Proſperity; he did not ſerve God for Riches, nor will he forſake him in Poverty: Haſt thou been a Profeſſor of Religion, and haſt thou hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to performed the duties Commanded? What madneſs now poſſeſſes thee, that thou wilt leave his Service? What canſt thou object againſt him? Is the Devil a better Maſter? Or will he ſet thee about better work? Or will he give thee better wages? If Religion be not good, why didſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it at firſt? If it be, why doſt leave it? If thou now leave off, all thy Labour, and all the pains that ever thou haſt taken will be utterly loſt in reference to Salvation; <hi>If the Righteous forſake his ways, all his Righteouſneſs ſhall not be remembred to him, in his ſin he ſhall dye,</hi> Ezek. 18.24. It may be thou haſt gone many a Mile to hear Sermons, ſpent many an Hour in Prayer, and Humiliation, &amp; many a Day in Faſting, and Humbling thy Soul; and wilt thou loſe all thy Labour at the laſt? Nay, wilt thou now diſhonour that God, which time was thou ſeemedſt to Honour? And wilt thou ſtrengthen the hand of Wicked Men in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs? And weaken the hands of poor doubting Dhriſtians? And ſadden the Hearts of the godly? Wilt thou bring the Blood of Souls upon thy own head? If not, hold on in a courſe of Holy Duty, Whatever oppoſition thou meet with in the way; Heaven will make amends for all the ſweat and blood thou loſeſt; and Hell will be ſower ſauce to thy ſweet Meat: What madneſs is it, to leave thy work a little before thou ſhouldeſt receive thy Wages?</p>

                     </label> Let all the Duties thou performeſt, either to God, or Man, proceed from a right Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; from a Heart ſanctified by Grace, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by Faith, and ſeaſoned with Love. Make the Tree good, and his Fruit will be good; but a Corrupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit. An evil Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit, nor a good Tree evil Fruit. 'Tis impoſſible that a Corrupt Fountain ſhould ſend forth ſweet Water, or a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Veſſel ſweet Liquor. Let the Love of God be the ſtrongeſt Motive to thy Obedience, and let this engage thy heart to every Duty: Though thou ſhouldeſt do the duty required, if thou do it not in obedience to that Command, God will not own it. Whatever thou doſt, do all to his Glory, and in Obedience to his Command, or thou wilt loſe thy Reward; let thy heart ſay in ſincerity, <hi>Propter te propter te Domine;</hi> it is for thy ſake, and in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to thy Command that I do it, and for no ſiniſter reſpect whatſoever. Hypocrites may do the thing which God Commands, but from another ground, and for another end; they ſavour of the Cask, and ſmell of ſelf-Intereſt; they reach no higher than themſelves, as water aſcends no higher than the Fountain Head. <hi>Jehu</hi> did what God Commanded in deſtroying Idolatry, and rooting out <hi>Ahab's</hi> Poſterity; but all this while he hath a Kingdom in his Eye. But the Love of God Oyls the Chariot-Wheels of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians endeavours; it carryeth him above, beyond, and out of himſelf. God tells him what he would have done, a Chriſtian never examines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by any Carnal Intereſt, whether he may reap gain, or loſs, Honour, or Diſgrace by it; come what come will, he reſolves to do it, if God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40419:27"/> it, whatever ſtands in his way, though he meet Death it ſelf in the Face, he will go on, God calls him; and, with <hi>Samuel,</hi> he cryeth out, <hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth;</hi> he knows he that ſets him on work, can bear him out. Now, all Service that ariſeth not from this ground, is ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, and mercinary, and merits nothing at Gods hands but blows; he that doth the thing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and knoweth not of the Command, doth not Obey God in the work; and if he know that it is Commanded, and doth it, yet not becauſe it was Commanded, but upon other account, God will not Reward this as Obedience. The <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> knew that Prayer, Faſting, and Alms-deeds were Commanded duties; yea, they performed thoſe duties, but not becauſe God Commanded them, but that they might be applauded by Men; therefore Chriſt ſends them to men for a Reward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1,2,3, &amp;c. The performance of a duty will do us little good, if we cannot ſay, with the Apoſtle, <hi>The Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are conſtant attenders upon the Ordinances, not out of Love to God, or Obedience to his Will, or any delight they have in the duty, but for fear of puniſhment, or hope of reward, either from God or Man; or for popular Applauſe, or one thing or other of that Nature; and theſe Men, perhaps, in the mean time have their handS upon the works, and their Hearts buſied in the Devils Service; and they look upon Gods Service as a Slavery, and glad when they are Releaſed. But a ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is like the Servant mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.15. that ſaith, <hi>I Love my Maſter, I will not go Free;</hi> though there were neither Reward in Heaven, for my Obedience, nor puniſhment in Hell, for my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40419:27"/> diſobedience, I will do it becauſe 'tis my Maſters will, and I delight in the work it ſelf; this Love of God in the Soul, is as weights to the Clock, or as Oyl to the Jack, it ſets it on work for God: love makes labour light, they do it for Conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. when others do it for gains ſake. <hi>Saul</hi> obeys for a Kingdom, and <hi>Jehu</hi> for a Crown, and when this was obtained, their Obedience was over; they are like to Dogs, they follow their Maſter till they meet with Carrion: examine now thy heart, what is the ground of thy obedience, if it be lower than thy love to God, and deſire to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, 'tis not right.</p>

                     </label> Let all thy duties whether to God or Man, be performed in the manner which God requires; now Chriſt himſelf tells thee, <hi>God is a Spirit, and he that worſhips him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit,</hi> John 4.24. and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that bodily exerciſe profiteth little, but godlineſs is profitable unto all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. 'Tis not the Motions of the Body, nor the moveing of the Lips, 'tis not Bowings, Couchings, Cringings that he is affected with, if the Heart and Affections go not along: this is one main difference between a ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and an Hypocrite; both may do the ſame Duty, both may joyn in the ſame Prayer, and both may hear the ſame Sermon, yet one may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and the other not; nay, for the Bulk and Materiallity of the Duty, the Hypocrite may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other; the <hi>Phariſees</hi> they faſted, they gave almes, they made long Prayer, they tythed Mint and Anice, and yet all this while lay under the Curſe, and were Enemies to God, and perſecutors of Chriſt; their heart was abſent from their duty, and it was not right to God, they loſt all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40419:28"/> in Heavens way, becauſe they had little tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with, and little knowledg of God, or their own hearts: Hypocrites feed upon the husks of duty, nnd never meet with Chriſt in the duty; when a ſincere heart hath trading with God, and ſweet communion with Chriſt himſelf: if ever therefore thou wouldſt perform pleaſing Sacrifice to God, be ſure to wind up thy heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto God, and never content thy ſelf with any duty till thou meet with Chriſt in the duty; duties are appointed to be done, not for their own ſakes, but to help the Soul to mount up to Heaven upon their wings, which is the place of its reſt: in them the Soul is trading with God for Chriſt, and if we make not this uſe of them, they will do us no good. God regards not ſo much the external part of duty, though this is not to be diſregarded, as he doth the internal; he looks, eſpecially at the carriage of the heart in the duty; <hi>my Son ſaith he, give me thy heart,</hi> if this be preſent, many infirmities ſhall be paſt over; if this be abſent, though the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be never ſo gloriouſly acted in the eye of of the World, it is hateful in the eye of God: <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> both offered Sacrifice, and in the matter of their Sacrifice we know not, the one exceeded the other, yet one was accepted, and the other reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: why what was the matter? becauſe the one was accompanyed with Sincerity, the other with Hypocriſie; and as God, ſo all good Men make it their buſineſs to look to the heart in duty, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it along with them to God, and offer it at his feet, they know the more of the heart is in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the better God loves it; and the more of the heart is in the ſin, the worſe it is: they look more and grieve more at the miſcarriage of the Heart in a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40419:28"/> duty, when it lyes dead, or dull, than at a miſ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or external failing; when thou comeſt therefore unto God in duty, gather in thy ſcattered thoughts and affections, and let them meet here as lines do in a Center, or as the Sun-beams in a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſs; this will make thy Prayers Hot and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, which otherwiſe would be Cold and Remiſs; when our Spirits are raiſed by the Spirit of God, and the Fleſh kept under in the duty, then we are like to prevail: 'tis not the Multitude of looſe or lone, and cold expreſſions will ſerve turn; the <hi>Phariſees</hi> out-did many Chriſtians in long Prayers: but 'tis the Spiritual performance that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; cold Petitions do but put denyals into Chriſts mouth, we muſt perform every duty as if it were for Life and Death, for Eternity; yea, as if it were our laſt duty that ever we ſhould perform: ſuch performances as theſe are acceptable to God, and beneficial to Man.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40419:29"/> and will puniſh us if we neglect them; as I ſhall more fully prove when I treat of them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that it is Gods will and command, is enough to ſatisfy an honeſt heart, though there were neither reward, nor puniſhment for the doers, or neglecters of them: this is the way to glorify God, <hi>John</hi> 15.8. <hi>Hereby is our Heavenly Father glorified, when we bring forth much fruit.</hi> Mat. 5.18. <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> By this means alſo we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental of others Converſion. Wives are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to carry themſelves ſo holily and wiſely, that thereby unbelieving Husbands may be won to the Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. and as they may do good to others, ſo they may bring comfort to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; theſe breathings out of Grace, will be an Evidence to the Soul of the love of God, when we find the Spirit helping our infirmities, teaching us how, and for what to pray: theſe products of Grace will yield the Soul no little ſatisfaction; yea, by this means we obtain many bleſſings from God: what ſweet returns of Prayer have the Saints had? how often hath God anſwered them in the very Petitions they have asked? Chriſt bids them <hi>ask and they ſhall have; ſeek and they ſhall find; knock and it ſhall be opened to them;</hi> and how many can experience this truth? though God promiſe the mercy, yet he will be ſought to for it, and what ſweet and raviſhing incomes of the Spirit of God have Chriſtians oftentimes in the Hearing, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Meditating, and conferring of the word of God; receiving of the Sacrament, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties? and what Satisfaction and Comfort? 'Tis true, we muſt not truſt to them for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40419:29"/> as the Cauſe, but as the Inſtrument: <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> found Comfort upon his ſick Bed from the Faithful performance of God's Will. But this is not all; one ſpecial end why God appointed them, is to bring the Soul nearer unto Chriſt by them, and to this end we muſt uſe them; they are as Ladders to help us up to Heaven, to lift us above our ſelves, to lay hold upon Chriſt; we muſt make uſe of them, as a Traveller doth of a Boat or Bridge, to help us over unto Chriſt; or as he doth of a Staff, or Stile, to help him in his Journey; though they in themſelves have no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, yet they help us over where true Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is; though they be empty in themſelves, and vain to thoſe that truſt in them, yet are they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching to the Saints that truſt not to them, but uſe them for the ends appointed; but many, like Fooliſh Lovers, wooe the Maid, when they ſhould Court the Miſtreſs; or like Fooliſh Travellers, play with the Stile, or fall in Love with the Boat, and neglect their way; they truſt to their duties; but theſe were never appointed to ſave us, or to make up Chriſt's Merits Satisfactory, for this is ſufficient; but that it may help us to lay hold upon Chriſt's Satisfaction: Uſe them therefore for that end.</p>

We muſt Live free from evil thoughts, vain words, and evil Actions, or we cannot ſtand approved by God; nay, if we could do ſo, and Live free from the leaſt Tranſgreſſion for the future, this will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge us of our fore-paſt Debt; will the conſtant payment of Rent for the future, clear up the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares that are behind?

               <head>CHAP. III. Directions in Hearing the Word.</head>
               <div type="introduction">
                  <p>HAving given you ſome general Directions neceſſary in all Duties, without which no duty, either to God, or Man can be acceptable to God. I ſhall next deſcend to ſome particulars which God requires at our hands, and lay down ſome Directions, how they may be performed to God's Glory, and the Souls Advantage; for 'tis not the meer doing of a duty, but the well doing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of it that attains theſe ends. The firſt I ſhall mention, is that great duty of hearing God's Word: (As for the Preaching of it, I ſhall give Directions among thoſe Relative duties; which, God willing, I intend to Treat of in it's place.) If I could ſufficiently inſtruct you in this, I need not ſpeak much of the reſt; for this would be a help in all the other: for in the Word are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the other alſo. I need not ſtand to prove this is a duty, I hope few will deny it. As for thoſe that are above Ordinances, ſo as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them, Time hath diſcovered their Folly: doth not God ſend his Meſſengers to Preach, and is it not our duty to Hear? The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is laid upon him, and woe to him if he preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.18. And is Preaching their duty, and is not Hearing ours? Yea, doth not Chriſt himſelf teach us how to Hear? And gives us Cautions to that purpoſe; to <hi>take heed how we hear, And what we hear?</hi> Mark 4.24. Luke 8.18. And oftentimes calls upon thoſe that have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40419:31"/> Ears to hear, that they ſhould hear; and in many Parables gives Directions about hearing, as in the Parable of the Sower and the Seed; of the good Seed, and the Tares, and many more. But my buſineſs is at preſent only by way of Motive, to put you on to the Duty; and by way of Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to help you in it: I ſhall at preſent uſe thoſe Motives, drawn from the benefit of the Word; for who is not moved with Profit and Gain? But here is the greateſt gain to be had, 'tis the ordinary means to bring Men to Chriſt; I ſay, the ordinary means, for God is not tyed to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14,17. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing;</hi> to this end God ſends <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gentiles, <hi>to open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Acts 26.17,18. When Chriſt met with <hi>Paul</hi> in the way, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.9,10. He doth not Inſtruct him himſelf, but ſends him to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by <hi>Ananias;</hi> and when he ſent an Angel to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> it was not to Preach the Goſpel to him, but to direct him to <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10.35. It was by Preaching that <hi>Peter</hi> Converted 3000. at one time, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.41. The Word is the Seed, that being ſown in a good heart, fructifies abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.8. The neglect of this is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.14. Whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> in the day of Judgment, than for them; and few are brought in that neglect this Duty: Nay, 'tis of daily uſe to thoſe that are Converted, to build them up; it is the Milk that muſt nouriſh them, and make them grow; for where there is Life, there muſt be Food: <hi>David,</hi> by this means became wiſer than his Teachers, and had more Underſtanding
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40419:32"/> than the Antient, and what condition ſoever a poor ſoul is in here, he may find directions. Art thou in ſorrow and diſtreſs? here conſolation is to be had; here the Soul by faith ſucks ſweetneſs out of the Promiſe: art thou in affliction? here are Cordials to uphold a fainting heart, directions to bear them well, and promiſes of a ſeaſonable deliverance: if thou run aſtray, here thou maiſt hear a voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee, ſaying, this is the way walk in it, God hath here ſet way-marks to guide thee: If thou be dead, or dull, here are rouſing conſiderations to quicken thee: if thy faith be weak, here it may be ſtrengthned: if thy Soul be ſin ſick, here is a Phyſitian directed to, and a Potion preſcribed will effect the cure: If thou art troubled with Satans Temptations, here is Armour of proof, the Sword of the Spirit for thy defence, with which Chriſt himſelf broke the Serpents head, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.4,7,10. In a word, here is that way to life pointed out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that will never fail; when all the learning in the World, and all Humane Policy, and good Meanings and Intentions will deceive: now that thou maiſt hear with profit, take theſe directions following.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="1" type="direction">
                  <p>
                     <label>1. <hi>Direct.</hi>
                     </label> If thou wouldſt hear with Profit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve then to break through all the difficulties, and oppoſitions that lye in thy way; for doubtleſs there will be many ſnares laid for thee, and thou wilt find many hinderances to this duty; many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will appear, and without a ſtrong Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go through, what ever danger lyes in the way, thou wilt hardly hold out. I do not mean that the curſory hearing of the Word is thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but the practiſing of it when heard. The Devil is a ſworn Enemy, and therefore expect he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40419:32"/> will do his worſt. Thou ſhalt find, that if he can have his will, there ſhall never Godly Miniſter be ſetled: Do you not ſee what oppoſiton is rais'd, what contention breaks out, before a faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor can be ſetled; what Inſtruments doth he uſe to hinder the work? Who will neither ſpare Coſt nor pains in the buſineſs. Or, if they be ſetled, how oft doth he raiſe one or other to worry them, and make them weary of their places, if not of their Lives? For he knows ſuch as theſe Diſcover his wiles, and hinder his Trade; and if he can but ſtop their Mouths, and drive them out into the Wilderneſs, he may Rule without controul. It be not the Drunken, Debauched Clergy that he fears, theſe bring Fiſh to his Net. If this will not prevail, he endeavours then to work ſuch a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in the Hearers Hearts, to their Miniſters, that they ſeldom profit by them: if they can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt them, but concerning the Law of their God, yet he perſwades them they are Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, becauſe more ſerious in Religion than ſome others are; and ſo diverts what he can from hearing them, and then he thinks himſelf ſure of them. Sometimes he ſets them about their World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſs, or to go to Fairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He knows there is no danger to him in that; or perſwades them to drouſe, or ſleep out their time, or ſit idly at home, or ſpend the Sermon time at Dice, or Cards, or other unlawful Games: For others, he hath a Companion at the Ale-houſe door to call them; he knows there they are ſecure. If thou break through theſe difficulties, he will endeavour to lull thee aſleep in the Congregation; or if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, to diſtract thy thoughts with Worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that when thy Body is in the Congregation,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40419:33"/> thy mind ſhall be in the ſhop or Fields; or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he may let thy Eyes wander upon this Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or that new Faſhion, and thus divert thy mind from thy Duty. And thoſe that would be very attentive at a Stage-Play, are very heartleſs at a Sermon, as if it did not ſo much concern them; or, if thou doſt hear attentively, yet he will make thee a forgetful Hearer, and pick up the Seed as faſt as 'tis ſown, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.4.19. How often do men leave all behind them at the Church door? and that man cannot give an Account of one paſſage in a whole Sermon, that can give you a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Stage-Play, or idle Tale, or Story; or, if any thing be remembred, it muſt be ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſion, or ſomething that muſt render the Preacher contemptible, and ſo bring him into Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: And if they remember any thing that is good, the Devil perſwades them they ſhall never practice it; or, at leaſt, defer it till hereafter: or if they practice any, it muſt be the light, and cheap, and eaſie part of Duty, and ſo as good never a whit, as never the better. Theſe, and a thouſand ſuch, are the wiles of the Devil to keep thy Soul in bondage, which if he do, thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. He hath Inſtruments alſo which he ſets on work, wicked men; ſome to draw, and ſome to drive; ſome by one means, ſome by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to hinder thee. Oh! take heed what you do, ſays one, you will run your ſelf upon the pike of danger; you'l make your ſelf contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the World, ſaith another; you'l hazard your Eſtate, or Liberty, crys a third; our Fore-Fathers, ſaith another, were honeſt men, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver followed theſe Courſes. Others, on the other hand, will load you with ſcoffs, and ſcorns; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40419:33"/> if this ſerve not, with down-right Perſecution: and, which is moſt dangerous, thy own deceitful heart will ſide with Satan, and help to betray thee; Carnal reaſon is ready to ſuggeſt, what need ſo much ado, there was never good World ſince there was ſo much Preaching? when, alas! the cauſe is not in the much Preaching, but in the little practice. Now, having ſo many Enemies, you muſt come with a full Reſolution to break through, or never begin.</p>

Many come that they may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forward Proſeſſors, and are tickled with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Applauſe; but when 'tis more in Credit to Perſecute than profeſs, theſe, perhaps, follow that Profeſſion. Some come, with the Butterflie, to paint her Wings, and theſe are all for gaudy Notions, and ſtore their Heads, and not their Hearts with what they Learn; ſome weary of their own Houſes, come to drive away the time; perhaps, to get a nap of ſleep; ſome come for fear of the Law, leſt that take hold upon them; and ſome to ſtop the mouth of Conſcience, which otherwiſe will give them no reſt; ſome come to ſpeak with a Friend, which otherwiſe they knew not how to meet with ſo conveniently; and as they came by chance, 'tis a great Chance if they receive any good by their coming: Some come to enquire out ſome good bargain, others to appoint ſome merry Meeting, or ſome drunken match, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40419:34"/> Game at Cards, or Dice, or Bowls; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſome come on purpoſe to entrap the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in his Words, or wreſt them to a wrong Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: theſe Mens memories are much like to Sives, they keep the refuſe, all the beſt runs through; Chriſt himſelf had ſuch Hearers: if theſe, or like to theſe, be thy ends, thy heart is rotten, thy Duties ſtink in God's Noſtrils, and they will never do thee good; thou mayſt expect a Curſe from God, and not a Bleſſing. But a true Chriſtian aims at higher ends, <hi>viz.</hi> that he may know his Maſters will, and knowing, may obey it, and may glorifie him by obeying; and by this means he may get nearer unto Chriſt, and have, and maintain more Communion with him; that he may know more of the Excellency that is in Chriſt; that he may be more enamoured on him; that he may ſee more of his own heart, and the deceitfulneſs of it; and more of the vileneſs of ſin, to hate it more; that we may have clearer Evidences of God's Love to his Soul, and of his Intereſt in Chriſt; theſe, and ſuch like are a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ends, in hearing the Word. If now thy ends be lower, 'tis a bad ſign of an Hypocritical, or Prophane heart.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40419:35"/> the Word is Gods Epiſtle ſent from Heaven, ſtuff'd thick with gracious promiſes; if we entertain hard thoughts of God, we ſeldom profit by his word; get a love alſo to his Word, as <hi>David, O how love I thy law, it is my Meditation continually:</hi> we remember that which we love; What is the reaſon that many can remember an idle ſtory, or love ſong, or ſtage play, that cannot remember one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, or ſentance in a whole Sermon? why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they love it better: exerciſe love alſo to the Miniſter, or thou wilt hardly profit by his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: prejudice is a great hindrance to the Soul. See this in <hi>Ahab,</hi> he had a prejudice againſt <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and hated him, and therefore his wholeſom coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was rejected, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees alſo having a prejudice againſt Chriſt, carp't and cavilled with him; but few or none believed in him: which of the Scribes and Phariſees have believed on him? all his gratious words would not win upon them: and when a People have a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt their Paſtour, ten to one they profit lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by him.

Come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Ordinance with an Hungring, Longing, Thirſting, Panting deſire after this Bread of Life, and Sincere Milk of the Word; for then thou art moſt like to prevail for ſomthing to fill thy Soul. <hi>A full Soul loatheth the Hony-comb, but to an hungry Soul every bitter thing is ſweet:</hi> many Promiſes are made to the hungry; thoſe that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs are bleſſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. theſe thirſting Souls ſhall have Wine and Milk, Chriſt and his Graces without Money or Moneys worth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.51.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40419:40"/> accordingly affected: preſs home every reproof to thy ſelf, and ſee how far guilty thou haſt been; mourn for it, and reform; lay to heart every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to duty, and let every motive ſtrengthen thy Reſolution, practice every direction, and make the beſt uſe of every paſſage for thy Souls good; and be ſure to practice what is taught thee: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou maiſt hear all the days of thy life to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe, 'tis not the hearers of the Law, but the doers that are juſtified; he that knoweth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will, and doth it not ſhall be beaten with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtripes; yea, 'tis not enough that thou practice it thy ſelf, but thou muſt endeavour that others may do ſo alſo: to this end thou muſt inſtruct thy Family, thy Children, and thy Servants what in thee lyes, preſs them on alſo to obedience, this is a commanded duty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. And it was the practice of the Saints in all Ages, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.4. and 31.1. And becauſe all thy ſervices without Gods bleſſing are worth nothing: 'tis thy duty to go to God by prayer, to faſten theſe truths upon thy heart, which thou haſt heard, and open the heart of thy Family; <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but 'tis God muſt give the increaſe:</hi> mark alſo from time to time how thou doſt grow, or decreaſe. Theſe Directions well uſed, through Gods bleſſing, will make thee profit by hearing.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Directions in Reading the Word.</head>
               <div type="introduction">
                  <p>THe next Duty I ſhall point out unto you, is the Reading the Scripture, and other good Books, which open and apply it; for this alſo is neceſſary, and very beneficial to the Soul: and though it be not ſufficient where the preaching of the word is to be had; yet, it is a neceſſary additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many a Soul hath had experience of much good received by it: this word is the Law of the Lord which is perfect converting the Soul; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances might be given of men converted by it; eſpecially where the word of God hath not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily been preached. That it is a commanded duty, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19. where the King is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take this book of the Law, and read therein all the daies of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord and keep his commandements; and if Kings themſelves are not exempted, notwithſtanding the multiplicity of their buſineſs, who then can plead exemption? yea, the Prieſts were to read it in the ears of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 31.11. 'Tis the Apoſtles advice even to <hi>Timothy, to give attendance to reading,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13. and as 'tis a commanded duty, ſo 'tis the practice of the godly in all Ages; <hi>Moſes</hi> took the book of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and read it in the ears of all the People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7. So did <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Chap. 8.34,35. So
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40419:41"/> did <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 34,35. and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> Chap. 8.38.18. and 9.3. thus the <hi>Enuch</hi> Acts 8.30. yea, there is a bleſſing pronounced upon it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſsed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophecy,</hi> and there is good reaſon for it, for as the Sun is to the World, ſuch is the Word of God to a Chriſtian, the very light of their lives, and the life of their Souls: but as it fares with the Sun, becauſe it commonly riſeth and ſets, therefore it is not ſufficiently heeded and admired; ſo 'tis with the Word, being common, 'tis not ſufficiently prized; <hi>Mannah</hi> you know was at firſt admired, at the laſt loathed: ſo 'tis here, if God ſhould ſend a Famine of the Word, it would be prized as it was when a Cart load of Hay was given for a few Chapters of the New Teſtament; the worth of it will be known in the want of it: as Health is beſt prized in Sickneſs, Peace in War, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Bondage. Now for the Perſons that ought to read, they are all that are in a Capacity; for if any were exempted they would be Kings, for the multiplicity of their buſineſs; but the book of God muſt be to them a <hi>Vade mecum,</hi> a conſtant Companion; Parents are to teach their Children in it, and under theſe two Relations, all Superiours and inferiours are contained, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. 'Tis the Devils practice and policy no doubt to keep Men from reading the Scriptures; Chriſt bids ſearch the Scriptures, and how dare Papiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeak the contrary? we are commanded to let the word of God dwell plentifully in us, and 'tis made a mark for a bleſſed man to meditate in Day and Night; here is the Mine out of which we muſt dig for knowledg, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3,4. Oh that men would ſpend that time in Reading, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40419:42"/> and conferring of the word of God; which they do in Vain, and idle Viſits, needleſs Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Carding, Diceing, Drinking, Drabbing, and ſuch like; how much would it conduce to their Souls health? this makes more to the evening their accounts with God, and making preparation for the Soul, than the other will: I know 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that the Scriptures are difficult to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and therefore dangerous to be meddled with, leſt they be abuſed; this is the Objection of the Papiſts on the one ſide, it being their intereſt to keep men in ignorance: and the Sloathful on the other, <hi>who will not Plough becauſe of Winter,</hi> Prov. 20.4. but this ſhould rather quicken our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, than ſerve for a diſcouragement; if difficult duties be neglected, we ſhall never reach Heaven, 'tis true ſome things are difficult, but the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary are plain and eaſie: here indeed a Lamb may wade, and an Elephant may ſwim, but the gains will countervail the loſs and charge; here is a Lamp to light us, the dew of Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us; a ſword to defend us, a key to open Chriſts will to us; flaggons of Wine, and Apples of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; take therefore theſe Directions in thy Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldeſt Read the Word with profit, 'tis neceſſary that thou prepare thy heart for ſo ſolemn a duty; come not out of a huddle of buſineſs, with thy heart full of the World, to diſcourſe with God; take not Gods word, any more than his Name, in vain: take it not prophanely into thy mouth, without due regard, or conſideration, leſt he turn thee away with a Curſe, inſtead of a Bleſſing: 'tis a buſineſs of great concernment, even of Life and Death; yea, of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40419:42"/> the Eternal well or ill being of thy Soul; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be ſlighted: beg leave therefore of God before thou meddle with it, yea, beg his bleſſing upon it, without which nothing can do us good for Soul or Body; the want of due preparation, cauſeth many to find the word ſo ineffectual: yea, find ſo little ſweetneſs in it. Again if thou wouldſt profit by it, hold on in a conſtant courſe of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'tis not reading by fits and ſtarts will ſerve turn; many are now off, now on; now they will, and then they will not; as the World gives them leave, or as the humour takes them: this is not ſufficient; but get a ſtrong Reſolution to hold on in a conſtant courſe of Reading what ever comes of it; break through all the difficulties that lye in the way, a little now and then, will do thee little good; without this Reſolution Satan will baffle thee, and lay ſome temptation in the way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: the World will divert thee, and one buſineſs or other preſent it ſelf to be done at the ſame time: thy own corruption will oppoſe it, and thy deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart make thee delay it; but this being the food of thy Soul, be not diverted from it any more, than thou wouldeſt be from thy Meat: but this is not ſufficient; thou muſt not only do the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but do it well: to this end get thy heart in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, get it cleanſed from diſtracting thoughts and cares, &amp; freed from diſquieted motions, &amp; perter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations: A full Veſſel can receive no more: and a heart full of the World hath no room for Heaven; ſay therefore to thy Worldly cares and thoughts when thou comeſt to this duty, as <hi>Abraham</hi> to his ſervants, when he went to Sacrifice; ſtay here and I will come to you again: ſet thy ſelf as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the great God; apprehend him by the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40419:43"/> eye of Faith, beholding thee; this will keep thy thoughts from roving, and thy imaginations from wandring, in his Service; and awe thy heart, and curb thy Affection. Bring with thee alſo a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Appetite, to the means of Grace; come with an empty ſtomack, or why doſt thou ſeek after Food? An hungry man is moſt like to taſte and reliſh thoſe dainties; the Word was to <hi>David</hi> ſweeter than Honey and the Honey-Comb; and to <hi>Job,</hi> better than his appointed Food: If there be Spiritual Life in the Soul, there will be an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; for no Life can be preſerved without food. Bring Faith alſo along with thee, which is the mouth of the Soul, and without this the Soul can receive no nouriſhment; <hi>The Word which they heard profited them not, becauſe it was not mixt with Faith in them that heard it,</hi> Heb. 4.2. Reading will do thee little good, if thou believe not the Truth of what thou Readeſt, or doubteſt of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Promiſes, or Threatnings. Faith alſo will ſubdue Carnal Reaſon, and help thee out when thou art at a ſtand. But above all, ſeek help from above, from God; here are many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties too hard for thee to grapple with, which cannot be underſtood but by Divine aſſiſtance. <hi>Paul</hi> may Plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> Water, but God gives the Increaſe: 'tis he that opened <hi>Lydia</hi>'s Heart, and muſt open thine, or the Word cannot do it; beg therefore his aſſiſtance, and come thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Duty; this is the likelieſt way to ſpeed.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldeſt profit by Reading of the Word, be ſure to propound right ends to thy ſelf; for the End Crowns the Action. Many read much, and profit little, becauſe their Ends
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40419:43"/> are bad; they undo themſelves, and loſe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by this means: Some Read for Cuſtom, and for Faſhion ſake, and make reading the end of reading; and are like the ſilly Women, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>always Learning, and never come to the knowledge of the Truth;</hi> and ſo the work be done, matter it no more: Some Read to fill their Heads with knowledge, and their Brains with Notions, that they may thereby be able to diſcourſe with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, when yet they never ſuffer it to ſink down, or ſoak into, or ſeaſon the heart; but ſuch ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative knowledge doth little good, yea, great hurt: It makes them ſin with a Candle in their hands. And ſome Read to a worſe end, that they may be able to oppoſe the Truth, and maintain Error, and pervert the good ways of God: thus the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> thus the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and many Hereticks: But every one ſhould, and a true Chriſtian doth, in this duty as well as others, make God's glory in the Salvation of his own, and others Souls the mark he aims at; and regulates his Actions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: And doubtleſs, from God he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Reward. When others, as it was ſelf they aimed at, ſo from ſelf they muſt expect their wages. A Believer, he would know more, that he may obey better; he would know God better, that he might Love him more; and know God's will, that he might do his work; he would know his work as well as his wages; his Duties as well as his Priviledges: He reads he word of God, and thoſe Books which open and apply it, that he may know Truth from Error; and follow the one, and fly the other; and may not be ſeduced by falſe Teachers, nor drawn aſide from the Rule to the Right hand, or to the Left: He would know Light
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40419:44"/> from Darkneſs, and have the Scales of Ignorance fall from his Eyes; he would know good from evil, that he might follow the one, and avoid the other; he would be able to try the Spirits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are of God or no; yea, to try all things, and hold faſt that which is good: he would know Vice from Virtue, and diſcern what is ſin, and what is duty; that he be not like thoſe that in Perſecuting the Saints, think they do God good Service: he would be acquainted with his own Heart, and know the ſtate of his own Soul, and whether his Evidences for Heaven be good or no: he obſerves what qualifications the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, for Heaven; and then by Scripture-Light he would diſcern them in his own heart, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to Read his own Name in the Book of Life, and ſee what Intereſt he hath in Heaven, in Chriſt, and Glory; and what Evidences for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and what Signs of his Election, Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Juſtification, and Adoption; and what right he hath to the Promiſes, which are his Father's Legacy: He would be able by the word to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Errors, and defend the Truth; yea, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the works of Darkneſs, and repel all the fiery Darts of Satan, and be able to walk comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the way to Heaven, and to fetch Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of God's word, to bear him up under the ſaddeſt Afflictions. They would be able to teach others in the way they ſhould walk, and Inſtruct them in the Holy Path, and reprove them when they err, and convince them when they go aſtray, and reduce them back that have wandered, and gone awry; and build them up that are already brought in: Theſe are ſome of the deſires of the godly in Reading the Scriptures, and not as the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40419:44"/> Butterflie, only to paint her wings; and theſe are the ends thou muſt aim at in thy Reading it, and then thou wilt Read it with Profit.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldeſt profit by thy Reading the Scripture, and other good Books, Read with the greateſt diligence, attention, care, and circumſpection, that poſſibly thou canſt; for all thou canſt do is little enough: This is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duty, and the work of God; and a Curſe is threatned to them that do the work of the Lord negligently. Curſory Reading will do thee little good; and hence it is, that many read much, and profit little, becauſe they read it careleſsly; many read an idle Romance, or wanton Love-Song more attentively than the word of God. Read it, as if it were for thy Life, and the Life of thy Soul, and for Eternity, as indeed it is: Set thy Heart upon it, then art thou like to profit by it. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Life and Death uſually affect us; and ſhall not matters of Salvation, and Damnation affect us much more? Were but thy Life endangered by a heartleſs, careleſs Duty, who would be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or careleſs, in the performance? Nay, how vigilant, diligent, careful, wouldeſt thou be? And is not the Life of the Soul much more worth? The word of God is of great Concernment; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the Author, or the Matter of it, it ſhould put us on to the utmoſt diligence: The Author is the great God of Heaven, one that can put Life into both his Promiſes, and Threatnings; nay, will do it, for he is Faithful. And the word is an Epiſtle ſent from Heaven, from this great God, and that for our Inſtruction, Admonition, Reproof, and Conſolation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. &amp; 10.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40419:45"/> afore-time were written for our hearing,</hi> &amp;c. This is God's Statute-Book, whereby he Rules the world, wherein are greater Rewards promiſed, to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and greater Puniſhments threatned to the diſobedient, than any King upon Earth can annex to his Law, or can Execute, if he ſhould threaten them. There is therefore great Reaſon why we ſhould be more converſant in thoſe Laws, than the Laws of the Land, though theſe be neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the danger is greater. In the one we ſtand in danger of Life, or Liberty, or Confiſcation of Goods; in the other, of Eternal Damnation. It is ſaid of the Jews, that many of them could as readily Anſwer to any point in the Law, as they could to their own Names; and that they knew how many words, yea, ſyllables, yea, letters were in the whole Law. God grant their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence riſe not up againſt us, to condemn us for our negligence. If a Father, or Maſter, or Ruler, or Prince, can Command Reverence from their Inferiors, ſurely God may much more from us. If we receive a Letter from a great Man with ſuch heedfulneſs, and Read it with ſuch diligence, and attention, and mark every paſſage with ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, and care; ſurely much more care and diligence ſhould be uſed in this Epiſtle ſent from Heaven; from the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Nay, but the Contents thereof, the Matter therein contained requires diligence; 'tis Matter of greateſt Right, and greateſt Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 'tis our Father's Will, and herein is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the Legacy he hath left us. Now, who will neglect a Fathers Will, wherein an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is bequeathed? Here is the Rule we muſt live by, and the Law we muſt be Judged by; and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40419:45"/> are theſe Matters to be ſlighted? Here is all the Evidence we have for Heaven; and ſhould this be diſ-regarded? How careful are Men of their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their Lands? They will hardly part with them out of their own Hands; and yet alas! how ſeldom do many men take theſe Evidences into their hands; too Evident a Sign they have, but little hopes of good by it. Now, without the diligent peruſal, how ſhall we come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them? Here are High Myſteries, in which we may eaſily be miſtaken, and 'tis very dangerous to be miſtaken: what need have we then of circumſpection? Theſe, and many other Conſiderations may put us on to diligence in Reading, Marking, and Obſerving the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

                     </label> Wouldeſt thou Profit by Reading? Then Read the Word with Judgment, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Diſcretion. This is neceſſary in every duty; nay, in every Action. <hi>A Wiſe Man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Orders his affairs with diſcretion;</hi> but it is required, eſpecially in a work of ſo High a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of ſo deep concernment, as this is: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Read much, and profit little, becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand little; they are like the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> to whom <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandeſt thou what thou Readeſt? He ſaid, how can I, except ſome man ſhould guide me?</hi> Acts 8.30,31. Now, diſcretion ſhould be uſed in regard of the Circumſtances; of Time, and Place, and Order, and Method; for the want of diſcretion in theſe, a duty may be ſpoyled: Concerning Time, every thing, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> is beautiful in it's ſeaſon; all our Time muſt not be ſpent in this Duty, then others as neceſſary would be omitted: one duty muſt not juſtle out another,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40419:46"/> yet ſometime muſt, and as much as can well be ſpared ſhould be reduced for it; yea, we ſhould rather redeem Time out of our ſleep, or recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than neglect it; and it ſhould be the moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time, a work is moſt excellent in it's ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Morning, and Evening ſeem ordinarily the fitteſt Seaſons for Reading the Scriptures in the Family, for private Reading as occaſion ſerves; and for Place, that which is freeſt from diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fitteſt for Edification, and Order; for private Reading, a private place, this doth moſt benefit a private Perſon, though that which is more publick Edifies more than one: A Method alſo is to be heeded in Reading the Scriptures, or any other Book; a diſorderly Action, or Duty ſeldom profits; Order, and Method are good helps to the Memory: Read the Scriptures throughout, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, except ſome Chapters that are leſs to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and ſo for other good Books, Read them throughout; he that Reads a Chapter here or there, at adventure; or, a leaf here, and another there, in another Book, profits little: and 'tis alſo neceſſary that thou underſtandeſt what thou readeſt; 'tis not ſo much the words and phraſes, as the ſenſe thou ſhouldeſt look after. The <hi>Jews,</hi> as I told you, had great care of the Scriptures; they counted the Words, Syllables, and Letters contained in the Law, and yet were Ignorant of the ſenſe, and miſt of the meaning. When thou readeſt a dark paſſage in the Scripture, reſt not till thou underſtand it: To this end Divines have given ſeveral Directions, ſuch as theſe: If thou be able, compare the Original and Tranſlation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and, perhaps, this may reſolve thy doubt; every Language hath a peculiar Elegancy: and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40419:46"/> ſome words are of ſo hard a ſignification, that they cannot fully be expreſt in a Tranſlation. Now, knowing the Original will abundantly help, and the knowledge of Arts, and Sciences is alſo of great uſe; let the Enemies to Learning ſay what they will to the contrary. If this help thee not, look into the Context, obſerve the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſcope of the Place, and receive no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which Croſſes that. If this will not do, compare this place with others the like, and admit not ſuch a ſenſe as contradicts other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; eſpecially compare it with the analogy of Faith, thoſe plain Doctrinal concluſions, gathered out of other plain Scriptures, of which no doubt is made, and if it agree not with this, reject it; for Truth it ſelf cannot oppoſe it ſelf. We muſt reduce dark places to thoſe that are plain; and not force thoſe that are plain to the dark ones. If this help not, read ſome Learned Expoſition upon the place: If this fail, ſeek aſſiſtance from God; for, as the Sun cannot be ſeen but by it's own light; ſo the will of God cannot be known but by his own Spirit: he that Faithfully, and Carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves theſe Directions, may through Gods bleſſing come to know as much as is neceſſary.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldeſt profit by the word thou readeſt, carefully obſerve the general ſcope of it, and what deſign God is aiming at, and what End he aims at, in it, and proſecute the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and aim at the ſame mark that he doth; for all Scripture is given for our Inſtruction. Now, if we heedfully mark the general ſcope of the Scripture, and the end which God drives on in the main, is to make himſelf known to the world, in his wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, to the end,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40419:47"/> that man may own him as their Lord, Owner, and Benefactor, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, for their Redeemer, and Saviour, that he might get himſelf Glory in their Salvation. Now, in thy Reading proſecute the ſame deſign that God doth, and aim at the ſame end which he doth; and this is the likelieſt way to profit. The Scripture in general ſets before thee the knowledge of God, and thy ſelf; what God is, and what he hath done; what thou waſt by Nature, what by the Fall, and what by thy Reſtauration: and alſo what God requires at thy hand. In the proſecution of this End, the Scripture handles thoſe points which conduce hereunto. As firſt, in the work of Creation thou maiſt ſee God in his wiſdom, and power, for none elſe could make the world of nothing; yea, every Creature will point out God to an underſtanding man; for it paſſeth the power of Men, or Angels, to make the leaſt Fly, eſpecially without pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent matter; nay, the Creatures do not only ſhew that there is a God, but alſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Wiſdom, Power, Majeſty, Goodneſs, and Perfection; theſe clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhine forth in theſe his works. The leaſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if you follow him home to his Original by Divine Meditation, will point out an Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Arm for his Creator: And when thou readeſt of his works of Providence, theſe alſo ſpeak the ſame thing, and Teach the ſame Leſſon. The wonderful works and Miracles he hath wrought for the preſervation of his People. The Rule and Government which he hath ſet in the world; the preſervation of his Church, and the frequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance he hath given to his People Recorded in the Scripture, beſpake to us his Power, Wiſdom,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40419:47"/> Goodneſs and Truth. When thou readeſt of the Works of Redemption; this beſpeaks Chriſt the Lord, the Son of God, as he is witneſſed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by Angels, by Saints, by Enemies, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, all which gave Teſtimony to his Divinity; and that he was truly man is alſo evident by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Birth, Growth, Actions, Paſſions, Death and Burial, and Reſurrection <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that he is the true Meſſiah, the Saviour of the World, is clearly evident by Scripture light; here thou maiſt finde that all the Propheſies that went before of him, are clearly fulfilled in him, and no other: and ſuch Miracles wrought, and ſuch mighty Works done, and ſuch gratious Words ſpoken, that make it plainly appear, that he is indeed the Son of God the Saviour of the World. Again, when thou readeſt the Commands, Threatnings, Puniſhments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Know theſe are to deterre thee from Sin, and to drive thee home to God thy Benefactor: and when thou readeſt the Promiſes, Invitations and Encouragements, theſe are to draw the nearer to him, therefore carefully obſerve what ever thou readeſt, and ſome way or other it will conduce to bring thee neerer to God: this is Gods end in writeing the Word, and ſhould be thy end in reading it.</p>

                  <p>THE next Duty I ſhall ſpeak of, is Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a neceſſary, though much neglected Duty. Yea, Chriſtians themſelves, that make Conſcience of other Duties, and are much in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, and Prayer, yet are too backward; yea, unskill'd in the right performance of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But did they know the benefit of it, and the incomes many receive by it, they would not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it: it brings much Advantage to a gracious Soul, and ſtores it with many Heavenly Truths, which thoſe that neglect it never attain: In this a man ingages all the powers of his Soul, and bends his mind to conſider, and muſe upon ſome Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Object; for I ſpeak not of it here, as wicked men uſe it, to deviſe miſchief; but as a Chriſtian duty. Now, Meditation is either Occaſional, and Sudden; or elſe Solemn, and Set, for both are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both are beneficial: The former is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by Objects occaſionally preſented, by the Providence of God; either to the Senſes, or brought to the Memory, and reſembles thoſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Ejaculations, ſuddenly occaſioned; only in the one a man ſpeaks to God, and in the other a man ſpeaks to his own Heart. Thus we ſee <hi>David,</hi> by beholding the Sun, Moon, and Stars, thoſe glorious Lamps of Heaven, he falls out into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, of God's Love to poor man, in raiſing him above theſe, and making him but a little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40419:50"/> Objects were the grounds of many of Chriſts ſpeeches, and Sermons: And a Chriſtian by this means may learn ſomething from every thing he either ſees, or hears.</p>
                  <p>That Meditation that is ſet and ſolemn, is, when a man ſeparates himſelf from other Imployments, and ſequeſters himſelf and thoughts from worldly affairs, to conſider of ſome portion of Scripture, or ſome point of Divinity, or ſome work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for his own ſatisfaction, and his Souls good. That this is a Chriſtians Duty few Chriſtians will deny; that it is a beneficial duty, all that have tryed it in good earneſt, will eaſily confeſs; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perto crede Roberto.</hi> That 'tis too much neglected, we may acknowledge with ſhame and ſorrow. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> was Commanded to Meditate in the Law of God day and night, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8. This was <hi>David</hi>'s practice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. And this he makes the Character of a Godly and Bleſſed man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2,3. It was <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Cuſtom; as alſo <hi>Paul</hi>'s and <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and many others. This is the way to digeſt the meat we eat; and can meat nouriſh, if not dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted? This is the chewing of the Cud, when we ruminate upon what we hear, or ſee: Meat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted in the ſtomack feeds Diſeaſes, when 'tis digeſted it feeds the Body. What is the Reaſon ſo many good Sermons are loſt amongſt us? And ſo many gracious Providences paſs un-obſerved, but for want of this? Doubtleſs, one Sermon well digeſted by Meditation would bring more nouriſhment to the Soul, and breed more good Blood, than now twenty do. By Meditation a man ſearches and ranſacks the Soul, and finds out every duſt-heap, every Corruption; and ſees whether thoſe Divine qualifications neceſſary to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40419:51"/> Salvation be there or no; when others are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at home, by this he gets light into the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, heat into the Affection, and it puts Life into all his Duties. By this he comes to ſee the Vanity of the World, the emptineſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the vileneſs of Sin, the beauty of Holineſs, and the fulneſs of Chriſt: By this the Heart is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the World, and ſet upon Heaven; and ſees by the Eye of Faith thoſe things which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible: By this he tramples upon ſublunary things, and fixes his Eyes upon things within the vail. By this <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw God, and <hi>Moſes</hi> talked with God; and <hi>Paul</hi> was carried up into the third Heaven. By this Afflictions are made light, and the Croſs ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and Chriſt's Yoak delightful: this makes a man chuſe Sufferings, rather than ſin; and pain ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſinful pleaſure: this helps the Soul to fly to Heaven, and hold Communion with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and like the buſie Bee, to gather Honey from Flowers and Weeds; which to effect, take theſe following Directions.</p>

                     </label> Concerning Occaſional Meditation, though it be not what I chiefly intend; yet being of daily Uſe, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. A Chriſtian that Trades for Heaven, may have much Goods brought home in this Ship: He may get Advantage by all he hears, or ſees, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves; for there is nothing in God's Book, or in the Book of Nature, but will Inſtruct us in ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Leſſon, concerning God, or our ſelves; and mind us of ſomething that may conduce to our Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: And he that can make a good uſe of every thing he ſees, or hears; and pick ſome Spiritual Food, and refreſhing from it, muſt, doubtleſs, be a flouriſhing <hi>Cedar</hi> in the Houſe of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40419:51"/> Heaven upon Earth, and Spiritualize all the Creatures. How often in Scripture may we read that Chriſt by occaſional occurrances, minds his Hearers of Spiritual things; from a Well of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he Inſtructs the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the water of Life. And by occaſion of Bread, he minds them of the Bread of Life: and from a Sower and his Seed, ſhews that a bad Heart is the cauſe that the Word proves unfruitful; and many more ſuch like. <hi>David,</hi> as before was hinted, beholding the Heavens, is raiſed up in his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, himſelf, and his Love to Man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.1,2,3, <hi>&amp;c. Solomon</hi> ſends the Sluggard to School to the Ant, or Piſmire, that gathers in Summer, for Winter: And Chriſt ſends thoſe that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful of their Fathers Providence, to obſerve the Fowls of the Air; how he feeds them: And the Graſs of the Field, how he Cloaths it; and no doubt but a wiſe man may make a Sanctified uſe of all theſe. If a good wit can make a good uſe of every thing, much more a good Heart: Had we but this Art of Meditation, every thing would yield a ſuitable object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have the whole world before us, the greateſt want is of a good Heart to improve theſe Objects, that offer themſelves to our view; the leaſt Creature would be uſeful, if we were not wanting; every day that paſſeth over our Heads, may put us in mind of our latter end. Thy Bed may mind thee of thy latter end, and the time when thou muſt lye in the duſt: and thy riſing up may mind thee of thy Reſurrection: The riſing Sun may mind thee what a glorious day that will be, when Chriſt with his Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhall appear at Judgment; each one ſhining as the Sun in his Luſtre. When Night approaches
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40419:52"/> it may minde thee that thy daies are numbred, and that thou haſt now one fewer to ſpend, than thou hadſt in the Morning; and mind thee what account thou canſt give of it, and make thee conſider that the World cannot recal it: Every Pain and Grief, Ach and Trouble, yea, every gray Hair, may mind thee of thy Mortality: and how little beholding thou art to ſin, which brought all this into the World? When thou ſeeſt the Heavens adorned with thoſe beauty ſpots, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, thou maiſt think, if the Porch be ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, what is the Pallace? if the Pavement be ſo beautiful, what is the Court? the Throne it ſelf? When thou conſidereſt their Beauty, Altitude, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, Selerity, and Influence, thou maiſt well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Creator; and with <hi>David</hi> cry out <hi>Lord what is man, &amp;c.</hi> Who can but admire when he looks upon the Earth, the Huge and Maſſy Globe; the unweiley Creatures hanging in the midſt of the Air of nothing, diſtinguiſhed into Hills and Dales, and Woods, and Rivers, furniſhed with ſuch variety of Trees, and Graſs, and Herbs, and Flowers, and the numberleſs number of living Creatures, Birds, and Beaſts, and Fiſhes, and creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and all provided for by the great Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder! Who can behold the Rageing Sea kept within his Banks in the Ebbings and Flowings, and view the Streams and Fountains, the Springs and Rivers, and not cry out the finger of God? now among all theſe, there is not one Fly or Flea, not one Graſpile, or Leaf of a Tree, but yields matter of Meditation and Admiration: Ah! what a rich Soul will that be that gathers fruit from all theſe?</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40419:52"/> well; 'Tis neceſſary thou ſet upon it with due preparation. I ſpeak not now of occaſional Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is the duty of all men, and at all times; but of ſet and ſolemn Meditation, which is a duty at ſome times only, and when thou comeſt unto it, thou ſhouldſt come preparedly: no duty can be well performed without, much leſs this, ſo ſerious and ſolemn a duty: this requires the exerciſe of all the powers of the Soul, and the whole bent of the Minde; they muſt be wholly ſet upon ſome ſpecial Object, which for the time we make the matter of our Meditation: this duty is as the chewing of the Cud in the clean Beaſts, or as in digeſtion to the Body: for as digeſtion turns Food into Soil, and Blood, and Spirits, and Fleſh; So Meditation turns thee Truths received into Affections, Reſolutions, Acts, yea, into a-Holy Life and Converſation: now the Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required, are either Internal or External; the Internal is chiefly the Heart, and the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Heart is the chief Inſtrument in the Work; if the Inſtrument be in Tune, the Muſick will be good; if that be out it will be little worth: The ſucceſs of the Work depends much upon the frame of the Heart: if that be right God will vouchſafe to dwell there, and give in his Aſſiſtance in the duty, and without his aſſiſtance the duty will do us little good: There muſt be Grace in the Heart, as well as knowledg in the Brain, or the Work will not proſper in our Hands: get thy affections as much off from the World, and as reſolvedly ſet upon Chriſt as thou canſt, for Chriſt will admit of no Partner; and as a gracious Heart, ſo an Underſtanding Head would much forward the Work: 'tis a ſweet Conjunction where theſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40419:53"/> meet, but if ſevered, the former is moſt requiſite: come with an empty Heart, and it will be filled; with an inlarged Heart, and it will be ſatisfied: this duty is enough to exerciſe the whole Man, were the Faculties a thouſand times more capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then they are; Angels themſelves cannot dive into the bottom of many Miſteries: lay by therefore all other Thoughts, Occaſions, Buſineſs and Concernments whatſoever, and gather in thy whole ſtrength, and ſet upon the duty; bring not a full Veſſel that can hold no more; if a Veſſel be full of Water, there is no room for Wine; if thy hands be full of Muck, thou canſt hold no Money; if thy Heart be ſtuff'd with Trifles, it can hold no better Treaſure; When thou mounteſt this Hill of Contemplation, be ſure, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> leave all at the foot of the Hill: ſay, ſtand by Pleaſures, ſtand by Friends, ſtand by World and Worldly things, I am going to Sacrifice, and will come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: When we come into our Princes preſence, we leave our Muck behind us, and bring no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable Company with us; much more when we come into Gods preſence caſt off all ſin; out with the World and Worldly thoughts: yea, all other thoughts, though at other times good, which will any ways diſturb thee; and diſpoſe thy buſineſs ſo that thou maiſt not be hindred: and for external preparation, it conſiſts in the Obſervation of ſome needful Circumſtances, as Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Occaſional Meditation all Times, and all Places are fit, when an opportunity is offered; but not ſo here: the Sabbath day is a fit time, when other duties are not on foot, but this is not enough, upon other daies experience will beſt inſtruct thee, when the Spirits are moſt lively, and active, and fit for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40419:53"/> the work, in the Morning, or in the Evening; the like I ſay for Place, where thou findeſt it moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient at home, or abroad; in the Houſe, or in the Field, the Place which is moſt ſuitable and freeſt from diſtraction is the fitteſt: <hi>Iſaac</hi> walked into the Fields, Chriſt in the Garden, <hi>Peter</hi> on the top of the Houſe; but I conceive ordinarily, for this ſet Meditation, that place which Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for private Prayer is ſuitable for this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret duty, <hi>viz.</hi> The Cloſet, with the door ſhut, <hi>Mat:</hi> 6.46.

                     </label> Having thus prepared matter, and pitcht upon ſome ſuitable Subject to Exerciſe thy thoughts and Meditations upon; proceed then to drive on thy intended deſign to a head; and to the end thou didſt propoſe. Now, this end ſhould be the enlightning of the Underſtanding, and the clearing it from Error, or Ignorance; and the quickning the Affections, and raiſing them to a higher pitch, and the bringing of the Will to a Reſolution. In Meditation, if rightly managed, the Soul Exerciſes two ſorts of Acts; the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, the other reflect: the firſt upon the Subject Meditated upon, the other upon the Soul it ſelf. By the firſt we find out the Rule, by the ſecond we apply our own Hearts to the Rule, and obſerve our deviation, and obliquity: the firſt enlightens the Underſtanding, and the other quickens the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40419:55"/> Affections; by the firſt we come to know what is true, what is falſe; what is good, what is bad; what is ſin, what is duty; and conſequently, what is to be choſen, and what refuſed: By the other we apply our Actions to this Rule, and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have walked according to it; wherein we have gone aſtray, and which way to return. Now, as there are two ſorts of Acts, ſo there is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent way for the Souls Acting, for the attaining of thoſe ſeveral ends. For the firſt of theſe, ſome have pitcht upon this courſe, which though all men are not able to follow, yet I ſhall ſet down for the uſe of thoſe that can. And that is to have recourſe to thoſe places that Natural, and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Reaſon affords us, which may help the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and ready the Memory, and much faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the Work; I mean, thoſe Logical places following: As firſt, to conſider the thing about which we Meditate, what it is; and therefore as ability doth ſerve, conſider it in the definition, or the deſcription of it; but ſtand not over-long, or over-nicely upon this, or any of thoſe that follow, leſt what you get one way may be loſt another; what you get in the Underſtanding, be loſt in the Affections. And when thou haſt found out the Nature of the thing, conſider it alſo in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of it, if it be a Subject capable of the ſorts, kinds, and parts of it; this will give room to thy thoughts, and thy proceeding will be more diſtinct: Conſider it alſo in the cauſes; the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Material, Formal, and Final Cauſe: The Efficient Cauſe is that by whoſe Virtue, Force, or Efficacy a thing is, The Material Cauſe is <hi>ex qua res eſt,</hi> of what matter a thing is made; the Form is whereby a thing is, that which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40419:55"/> it is, and the end is the Cauſe for whoſe ſake, or for what purpoſe a thing is. Conſider alſo if the Subject will admit, the Fruits and Effects; for theſe are uſeful, and helpful in the work, and are alſo pertinent to our buſineſs. Conſider alſo the Subject wherein it is, and about which 'tis oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied; as alſo of it's Properties, and Qualities; either adhering to it, or inhering in it; together with the oppoſite and contrary; this alſo is uſeful: alſo the comparats, and deſperats; what it is like, and what it's unlike; fit ſimilitudes, much Illuſtrate, and give great light to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Teſtimony alſo is to be regarded, but Noble Command aſſent like thoſe of Scripture; Holy mens Teſtimony is of good uſe, but Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is all in all. Or if you think this way too intricate, you may take ſuch a Method as is moſt Familiar to explain the Subject you treat of; raiſe thy Obſervations, clear the Doctrine from diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and doubts; prove it both by Scripture and Reaſon, and then make uſe of it according to the Nature of the Subject; let it inform thee in the uſeful conſectaries, and concluſions, that may thence follow; let it Inſtruct thee in the duties it reaches forth; let it be for Examination, how thou haſt carried thy ſelf, or whether thou haſt the required qualifications for reproof: if thou haſt gone aſtray; for incouragement: if thou haſt done thy duty; for caution, for the time to come; and preſs all home upon thy heart: Such a courſe is like to furniſh thee with ſutable matter for thy Souls good.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40419:56"/> out, by the uſe of Reaſon, and Scripture-Light, what is Truth, and what is Error; what is ſin, and what is Duty; what thou oughteſt to do, and what to avoid. Thy next work is to preſs this upon thine own Head, and compare thy Head and Actions with the Rule, and try wherein thou haſt gone right, and wherein thou haſt gone aſtray: for if thou do not thus reflect back upon thy own Heart, and Life, the duty will do thee little good. If thou only ſtudy to find out Truth from Error; or what is ſin, and what is duty, without Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thy Life and Actions accordingly; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fill thy Head with Notional knowledge, it will but aggravate thy ſin, and thou wilt ſin with a Candle in thy hand. But when by this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Tryal, thou findeſt out wherein thou haſt ſinned, and come ſhort of thy duty, which the Law of God requires at thy hand; or wanteſt thoſe required qualifications neceſſary to Salvation: Preſs thoſe things home upon thy heart, till they make ſome Impreſſions there; yea, till they ſtir up the Affections, and work upon the Will to a through Reſolution of Reformation for the time to come. This is the Life of Meditation, and without this 'tis little worth. When thou findeſt wherein thou haſt come ſhort, to come to a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to make more haſt: and where thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, gone aſtray, to return; and where thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to Reform: Preſs on thy Meditation till thou findeſt ſome Life in it, according to the Nature of the thing: if it be good, till thou find a ſweetneſs in it; if bad, till it appear odious. If it appear to be good by Scripture-light, and rectified Reaſon, then the affection of Love muſt needs be ſtirring, for good is it's object, and evil as evil cannot be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40419:56"/> loved. When it appears to be bad, the affection of Hatred will cloſe with it as it's object, for the Underſtanding when 'tis informed, in the Nature of the thing according to it's apprehenſions, and concluſions ſends down report unto the Heart, where the affections dwell, and every affection cloſes with it's proper Object: Love with good, and Hatred with evil. Good things difficult to be obtained, ſtir up deſire; evil likely to ſome ſtir up fear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> This will make thee bewail thy miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when thou canſt not enjoy the thing deſired, yet long, and hunger, and pant after it, as <hi>David</hi> did for the enjoyment of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. He that taſts the ſweetneſs of it, and cannot get it, muſt needs earneſtly long after it. Whether it be the removing the Judgment, or the Sin that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it; or whether it be the attaining the gifts and graces, which we want, it will work in us a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to our power to endeavour the obtaining of the thing we want: and when we find it is not in our own power, this will put us on to a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go to God, in whoſe power it is to diſpoſe of theſe things; to confeſs our wants and failings, and imperfections, and diſ-ability; and, like a Beggar, unlap our ſores, to move pity, and to Petition him to grant us thoſe things which we ſo earneſtly deſire; and reſt confident we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Mercy deſired; the ground of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is the promiſe of God, who bids us <hi>ask, and we ſhall have; ſeek, and we ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened to us.</hi> And the Experience of the Saints in all Ages, who have thus prevailed.

                     </label> In Meditation beware of thoſe things which uſually prove hinderance in the Duty; for whoſoever ſhall make Trial of it, ſhall find enough to do to manage it well, and perform it well as it ought to be. The Devil, that knows how much he is diſadvantaged by it, will never ſuffer thee to do it without oppoſition: he lays many ſnares to intangle the Heart, and render it unable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the work: If he can divert the Heart, which is the moſt neceſſary Inſtrument in the work, he is well enough; hence often he ſteals it away: and as in Prayer, when we ſhould ſeek God, we had need to ſeek our own hearts. So alſo in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for the Heart many times, like a ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant, gives us the ſlip, when there is moſt work to do: Sometimes the Devil fills the Heart with diſtracting cares, and thoughts of the world, which commonly croud in upon us, when they ſhould ſtand back, and give place; this is an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance in all duties, but eſpecially in this; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole man is required, and the Heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſpared: here we ſhould have an heart in Heaven, but how can it mount up, when her wings are clipt? And her feet fetter'd, and clog'd? How
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40419:57"/> can our thoughts ſoar aloft, when they cling faſt to the Earth? How unſtable to the duty is it when we come with a Fancy of ſome Earthly Happineſs? Or hug ſome thriving Project in our Brain? And ſolace our ſelves with ſome Worldly Advantage, while we pretend to have our Converſation in Heaven, and our Communion with God. The Scripture tells us, <hi>The Friendſhip of the World is Enmity to God; and he that is a Friend to the World, is an Enemy to God,</hi> James 4.4. The Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth, <hi>not to Love the World, nor the things of the World; and if we Love the World, the Love of the Father is not in us,</hi> 1 John 2.15. Beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this ſnare, entertain no Diſcourſe with the World till thou haſt finiſhed the work that lies before thee. Do, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> leave thy ſhooes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee, when thou comeſt into God's preſence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. Or, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> all at the foot of the Hill: when thou aſcendeſt this Mount of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, ſay, ſtand by Profit, ſtand by Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſtand by World, till I come again; and though theſe knock at the Door, open it not; come not with a Love or liking to any known ſin, this is a notable hinderance in this caſe, and will ſpoil thy Duty; this dimmeth the eye of the mind, that it cannot ſee Spiritual things: As it hinders Prayer, ſo it hinders Meditation alſo, <hi>Pſal</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, God will not hear my prayer,</hi> neither will he ſucceed thy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Thoſe that will preſerve precious Liquors, put them into clean Veſſels; and thoſe that will ſtore up clean, and Holy Thoughts, muſt put them into pure Hearts: what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs, or what Fellowſhip hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Belial?</hi> If thou uſe violence to thy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40419:58"/> Conſcience, thou art a ſtranger to an Heavenly Life. Lazineſs alſo is another hinderance to this work, when men are loath to take pains with their own Hearts; and Meditation cannot be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged well without much pains, there is ſcarce any thing hinders knowing men more than this; when men cannot away with diligence, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omit, or ſlubber over the Duty; and as good never a whit, as never the better: few men are willing to ſequeſter their thoughts, and affections from the World, and to be intent upon the Duty, and Exerciſe their Graces in their Order, or their Affections upon their proper Objects, and hold them there till they find ſucceſs. The Heart of man will prove falſe, and Treacherous, and is hardly brought unto, or kept upon the Duty; it will find ſome ſtarting hole or other, and frame ſome excuſe to be gone, if we uſe not violence to force it: How lazily will it demean it ſelf? How ready will it be to depart before the work be done, and make ſome Vagaries, or entertain the thoughts of the World, or divert it ſelf to ſome more pleaſing Objects; and if thou look not about thee, will paſs away the time idly, and give over before the work be brought to any perfection: but thou muſt deal by thy Heart, as thou wouldſt do by a ſleighty Servant; perſwade, command, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and chaſtiſe, force it into the preſence of God, and let it not ſtir till the work be done.</p>

We are apt to be ſenſible of our preſſing wants, and our deſires are let out for a ſupply in our needs; God hears of us then, we cry, ariſe, and ſave us: but a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heart ſhould be as ſenſible of Mercies, as of Miſeries; and be as ready to render praiſe for the one, as to put up Prayers for the removal of the other: But moſt men are like the Lepers; of ten, that are healed, but one gives thanks.

Thou wilt but ſin with a Candle in thy hand: but if upon theſe Conſiderations, thou ſet thy ſelf to hate ſin, as the greateſt evil; and walk in the path which is called Holy, in ſincerity; then ſhalt thou reap Fruit by thy Meditation. If thou find upon Conſideration, that God is the chiefeſt good, and Love him as the chiefeſt good, happy wilt thou be: If thou find the Devil to be the worſt Maſter, and break out of his Priſon, and reſolve thou wilt never give him one more Act of willing Obedience, 'tis well: or, if thou find in the reach of thy Heart, that thy Grace is not true, and thereupon thou reſolveſt never to give thy Heart any reſt, till thy Relation be changed; and God be thy Father, and Chriſt thy Husband, 'tis well: Or, if in the ſearch thou findeſt Evidences of true Grace, Record them; they will be of uſe in a day of deſertion, and help againſt the Devils fiery Darts: The Reſult of <hi>David</hi>'s Meditation was to return home to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59.

Now, Prayer is an Offering up our deſires unto God, in the Name of Chriſt, by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, with Confeſſion of ſin, and thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's Mercies received; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.8. <hi>John</hi> 18.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.5,6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. For the kinds of it you may take notice, there is Confeſſion, when we acknowledge our ſins to God: There is Petition, when we beg of God thoſe things neceſſary for Soul, or Body, for this Life, or that to come: There is Deprecation, when we beſeech God to turn away the evils felt, or feared; from our ſelves, or others: There is Interceſſion, when we pray for others alſo; and there is Thankſgiving, when we thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Mercies received. Now, Prayer is either publick in the Congregation, or private in the Family, or ſecret in the Cloſet: each of theſe ſhould have their time; each hath a Promiſe, and we may find Precepts for, and Example of them.

                     </label> There are ſeveral Qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to every one that would rightly perform this Duty of Prayer, in an acceptable manner, without which a Bleſſing cannot be expected; for though Chriſt bids <hi>ask, and we ſhall have; ſeek, and we ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened to us.</hi> Yet St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, we ask, and have not, becauſe we ask amiſs. It is neceſſary, in the firſt place, that thou be a Child of God, and have the work of Grace wrought upon thy Heart, or otherwiſe thou haſt no aſſurance of being heard: The blind man, <hi>John</hi> 9.31. could ſay, God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not Sinners. I know 'tis the Duty of others to pray; and the Apoſtle incourageth <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to the Duty, if, perhaps, the thoughts of his heart might be forgiven: But, till the Heart be brought over to God, we have no aſſurance that God will hear us: the Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to God; till then, we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably call God Father, nor come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace; neither will Chriſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, or Intercede for us, while we remain his Enemies; neither will the Spirit of God aſſiſt us in the Duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. It is in Chriſt, and through Faith, that we have boldneſs and acceſs with Confidence to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 12. 'Tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alſo, that we hate ſin, if we come to God; for he is a devouring Fire to his Enemies, and will not be reconciled to thoſe that are reconciled to Sin: How can we heartily pray againſt Sin, and for Holineſs, if we love Sin, and hate Holineſs? As all unconverted Sinners do. This is diſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God, when the Heart is not with him; <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, God will not hear my Prayers,</hi> Pſal. 66.18. Yea, God,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40419:62"/> who is Holineſs it ſelf, requires Holineſs in all thoſe that draw near to him; and he being a Spirit, will be Worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth: <hi>Without Holineſs no man ſhall ever ſee God with Comfort,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Knowledge alſo is requiſite, for God cannot abide the Blind, and the Lame in Sacrifice; without this the mind cannot be good, nor the Service acceptable: without this a man knows not what to pray for, or what to pray againſt; what to ſeek, or what to ſhun; what is ſin, or what is Duty; what he wants, or what he hath; and what blind worſhip is he like to offer, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Pray as he ought. Self-denial alſo is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he ſhould in all things ſubject his will to the will of God. A notable Example we have in <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, whoſe Meat and Drink it was to do his Fathers Will. So when he had prayed that that bitter Cup might paſs from him; yet adds, not my Will, but thine be done: and thus he hath taught us to pray, <hi>Thy Will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> Faith alſo is require<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; for if thoſe ſhafts of Prayer, are not headed by Faith, they will never reach Heaven; this is the Condition required, whatſoever you ask believingly, you ſhall receive, <hi>and without Faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. Nay, further, Patience is alſo required; we muſt wait for an Anſwer, not like thoſe ſhort-winded <hi>Bethulians,</hi> that ſet God a time, and will wait no longer: but refer all to his Will, who beſt knows his own time; yea, the beſt time, and fitteſt Seaſon. He ought alſo to be an Humble man; for <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble:</hi> He that hath not low ſelf-denying thoughts of himſelf, God will have low thoughts of his Service; he fills the hungry
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40419:63"/> with good things, but the Rich he ſends empty away. He muſt alſo beg for the power and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. God knows the voice of his Spirit: Come not in thy own ſtrength. Thou muſt alſo be painful, and Laborious; not only pray for Mercies, but endeavour for them; a few faint wiſhes will not ſerve turn: Sin muſt be fought againſt, as well as pray'd againſt: endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours muſt be uſed.</p>

                     </label> Before thou come to this Duty of Prayer, prepare thy Heart to meet the Lord thy God, in ſo ſolemn a Duty. Wert thou but to meet ſome Prince, or Noble Man, thou wouldſt make ſome Preparation; much more ſhouldſt thou when thou art to meet the great God, one that knows the Secrets of thy Heart, and thy Ends and Motives in the Duty. What buſineſs of Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there, but needs ſome preparation? Much more, when the Soul is ſo deeply concerned in it. Examine therefore what Relation thou ſtandeſt in to God; whether he be a Friend, or an Enemy. Who can come with boldneſs to him, that hath offended him, and is not Reconciled? If thou haſt not a Mediator to Intercede for thee, and a Surety to undertake thy Debt, how dareſt thou approach to the Creditor, to whom thou oweſt ten thouſand Talents, and canſt not pay a Farthing? How dar'ſt approach this Conſuming Fire, that art but Chaff, and Stubble? And what hopes haſt of ſpeeding, if thou be not within the Covenant? The promiſe belongs not to thee. But when thou canſt find an Intereſt in God, and in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and in Chriſt; canſt call God Father, yet ruſh not rudely into his Preſence, but ſtudy well what things he hath promiſed; for thoſe thou maiſt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40419:63"/> boldly ask: Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs, but his Word ſhall not paſs, till it be fulfilled. But if thou ask amiſs, that is, what he never promiſed, no wonder if thou receive it not; acquaint thy ſelf well with the Attributes of God; his Power, Goodneſs, Juſtice, and Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This will be an Excellent Foundation for thy Faith. And when thou art come before him, ſet thy ſelf as in his Preſence, and let thy Heart be affected with awful Reverence of him, who is the Searcher of the Heart, and Tryer of the Reins. There's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that come to him in prayer, and little conſider with whom they have to do. Come alſo with a full purpoſe, and Reſolution, (or elſe never come) to leave, and forſake all thoſe ſins thou ſhalt confeſs; <hi>For if thou regard Iniquity in thy Heart, God will not hear thy Prayer,</hi> Pſal. 66.18. 'Tis a vain thing to think to get pardon for thoſe ſins thou wilt not leave; or a diſpenſation to Sin. Meditate before hand of the Number, Nature, and Quality of thy Sins: Of the Purity of God's Law, the Juſtice of God, his Threatnings againſt Sin, and Sinners, and the puniſhments he hath brought upon the World for ſin; the little Good that Sin hath done thee, and the great hurt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Conſiderations may work in thee a loathing of ſin, when thou ſeeſt that it is the cauſe of all thy Miſeries, then wilt thou put up real deſires to have it Mortified; and till then thou wilt but dally with God. Study well before-hand what are thy wants, which thou wouldſt have ſupplyed by God. Let it be thy daily work, to think what Sin, and Corruption is ſtrong in thee, and what Grace is weak or wanting, and what thou wouldſt beg at God's hands; and have not thy Errand to ſeek,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40419:64"/> when thou ſhouldſt do it. Study well alſo what Mercies thou haſt received, and forget not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to God the Tribute of Praiſe: Thankfulneſs for one Mercy, is a real Petition for another. Many, like the <hi>Lepers,</hi> will come in a Petition for Mercies they want, but few in Thankſgiving for Mercies received: Moſt men are like the Swine under the Tree, they eat the Crabs, or Acorns, but look not up from whence they come: And where as 'tis a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duty to Pray one for another, 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we ſympathize one with another. Mourn with thoſe that Mourn, and Rejoyce with them that Rejoyce: It was <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s practice (and he ſhould herein be our Preſident) when all went well with him in his own particular, the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church could wring Tears from his Eyes, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.4. And if any jarr be between thee and another, be Reconciled, this is Chriſt's Counſel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.26.

But in the whole Book of God there is not one Precept for, or approved Example, of any one, that ſought either to Saint, or Angel; nor any Promiſe to any that do ſo, or any Experience that any have had any Return to their Prayer; no, nor encouragement to provoke us to believe that God approves it, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. There is nothing in Scripture to ground our Faith upon, and <hi>what is not of Faith, is Sin.</hi> We may find God himſelf ſtiled, A God, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayers; A Title given to no Creature, in Heaven, or in Earth. God is Omniſcient, and knows all things; the very thoughts, and wiſhes, the ſighs and breathings, the longings, hungrings, and pantings of a broken Heart, are known to him; and he knows when Prayers proceed from unfeigned Lips; he is <hi>Hoker Lebh, Scutator Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis; The Searcher of the Heart,</hi> Jer. 17.10. And 'tis a Priviledge, that no man on Earth can claim; neither have we any aſſurance, that Saints, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven can do it. Again, he is every where preſent, at all times, and in all places (which the Angels themſelves are not, being finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) and therefore is always in a readineſs to help. We know he hears our Prayers, but have no aſſurance that the others do: He is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and able to help us; he is, <hi>El ſhaddai, God
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40419:65"/> All-ſufficient,</hi> Gen. 17.1. Able to remove all rubs out of the way; but the Creature cannot help us, they are but the Ciſtern, he is the Fountain, they have no more than what he puts into them. Yea, all Religious Worſhip is due to him alone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Prayer is a principal part, and cannot be given to another without offence. 'Tis from him that <hi>we receive every good and perfect gift,</hi> James 1.17. and therefore unto him we ſhould go to beg it, who keeps the diſpoſe of them in his own hands, and will be ſought unto before he part with them. God is the Object of our Faith, and ſhould be of our Prayers; for, <hi>How can we call upon him, upon whom we have not believed,</hi> Rom. 10.14. The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, by the Light of Nature, acknowledge this Priviledge; this Duty was due to God alone: they put up their Petitions, to thoſe they eſteemed gods, as the Mariners in <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Ship, called every man upon his god, and adviſed <hi>Jonah</hi> to do ſo alſo, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5. And God himſelf threatens the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that call not upon his Name, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. And in their diſtreſs threatens to ſend them to the gods they ſerve. How much then are thoſe to blame that Pray to Saints, and Angels, as the Papiſts; or offer up Religious Worſhip to any other but to God alone, but till they can prove it a Duty by direct precept, or approved Example; till they can prove they are Omnipreſent, always at hand; Omniſcient, and know all things; Omnipotent, and can help us in all our ſtraits, which they will never do; lets us never leave the Fountain that is all this, and go to the Ciſtern that cannot help us.</p>

We are by Nature Enemies to God, and he is a conſuming Fire to his Enemies, and Chriſt muſt be the Skreen, to keep us from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'tis he alone that can Reconcile us to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: 'Tis he in whom he is well pleaſed, and through him he cannot be offended: He is the High-Prieſt, that Offers up the Prayers of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he hath perfumed them with the Incenſe of his own Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. 'Tis he that preſents their Prayers to God, and makes them acceptable, which otherwiſe would be abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: He is the Altar, whereon a broken Heart muſt Offer up the Sacrifice of Prayer, and Praiſe. Now, when I ſpeak of going to God in the Name of Chriſt, I do not only mean uſing Chriſt's Name to God, or Concluding our Prayers with ſuch words, <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.</hi> Though this is Lawful, if ſerious, yet not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; we read of ſome, Mat. 7.22. that had Preached in his Name, and in his Name had caſt out Devils, and in his Name had done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works; and 'tis probable, they had prayed in his Name alſo, and yet he would not own them. But thoſe that come in his Name, muſt believe in him for Salvation; roul themſelves upon him, lay hold upon him by a Lively Faith, for their Lord and Saviour; for their Head, and Husband; for their Mediator, and Advocate; and give up themſelves wholly unto him: Take him upon his own terms, as he is offered in the Goſpel; to love him above all, and forſake all others for him; to obey him in all, though all the World be offended
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40419:66"/> at it; to reſign up our ſelves, and all we have to be at his diſpoſe; to be willing to be any thing, do any thing, ſuffer any thing, he would have us; and ſo to come with Confidence to God, truſting in the Merits of Chriſt; believing that for his ſake we ſhall have our ſins pardoned, our wants ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and our Souls ſaved. He is the only way to the Father, and without him we can have no Admittance; he opens the doors, and brings us into the Preſence-Chamber, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. He is the only Mediator between God and Man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. Now, God never gave any ſuch Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Saints, nor Angels, in the Scripture, though he denies them none that is their due. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promiſes we have, that whatſoever we ask in Chriſt's Name, ſhall be given us, <hi>John</hi> 14.13. But no promiſe in Scripture of prevailing in any other Name: Nay, the contrary; for if <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> departed Saints, whom God dearly Loved, could not be heard for Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14, &amp;c. What hopes can we have of others? Perhaps, the Papiſts will tell us, they do not pray to Saints, or Angels, that they ſhould help them, but only Mediate for them; but who made them Mediators? There is only one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and Man, even the Lord Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.5. And there is no other qualified for the Office: 'Tis neceſſary that he muſt be both God, and Man; that is, to Mediate between God and Man, and that he be perfectly Righteous, which no Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt excepted, ever was: All others have Oyl little enough, and none to ſpare. Neither doth the Scripture make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other; nay, excludes all other: For Chriſt is called the only Mediator. None can
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40419:66"/> make our imperfect prayers acceptable to God, but he; none can be preſent in all places, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all Petitions, but he. The Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are but finite Creatures, and cannot be in all places at once; and what aſſurance can we have, when we pray that they are preſent, and hear all prayers, and underſtand all Languages: How can <hi>Peter,</hi> or the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> at the ſame time, be preſent at <hi>Rome, Venice, London,</hi> and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand places at once, if they are not Infinite? As we have no Precept in Scripture, to make theſe our Mediators; no more have we Examples of any that did, though there were many Saints then dead, <hi>Job</hi> 5.1.

A wicked Man may put up a good Petition, when God regards it not. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>'s wiſh was good, to dye the Death of the Righteous, and that his laſt end might be like his. Now, as it muſt proceed from a Right Fountain; a Heart purified by Faith: So every Petition muſt be pointed by Faith, or it will never pierce Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Nay, 'tis not enough to have Faith in the Habit, but it muſt be in the Excrciſe alſo, and drawn out into the Act, <hi>without Faith we cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. No wonder then, if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens prayers are rejected, <hi>for all men have not Faith.</hi> Now, Faith helps a man to a Foundation to build upon, the Promiſes, and Attributes of God; this keeps the Heart from wavering, and the Soul from fluctuating. It points us out to Chriſt, the Mediator, ſitting at the Right hand of God; which offers up our prayers, and brings us an Anſwer of peace. Now, though Faith be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, yet 'tis not ſufficient; there muſt be Repentance alſo, and hatred of ſin: <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, God will not hear my Prayer,</hi> Pſal. 66.18. <hi>Non prodest medicam ſalum, dum ferrum in vulnere,</hi> let every Sin thou confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, draw ſorrow from thy Heart; and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, Tears from thine Eyes; ſuch prayers are likelieſt to prevail with that God that cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Iniquity with approbation. So likewiſe Zeal, and fervency is a neceſſary Qualification; 'tis not every cold Petition will get Admittance at the Throne of Grace, or pierce the Ears of God; he hears not ſluggiſh prayers, this puts denials into
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40419:68"/> his Mouth: Every one can deny a cold Suitor. Had the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> been of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſhe had gone away without an Anſwer. We ſhould <hi>be fervent in Spirit, ſerving God,</hi> Rom. 12.11. 'Tis God's complaint, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They have not cryed unto me with their Heart.</hi> Prayer is a part of God's Worſhip, and a Curſe is threatned to them that do the Work of the Lord negligently. The buſineſs is of great Concernment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not be ſlightly performed. If a Man were to beg for his Life, how earneſt would he be? He would uſe all the Arguments he could, and beg heartily. Now, this is for thy Life, and the Life of thy Soul; if thou prevail, well and good; if not, thou art undone; Men, or Angels cannot help thee, thy Diſeaſes are ſo many, and thy wants ſo great. Theſe Zealous Prayers are ſometimes called, the renting of the heart, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. Sometimes wraſtling with God; and thus <hi>Jacob</hi> wraſtled, and prevailed: And in Scripture 'tis ſometimes expreſſed by the Motions of the Body; <hi>Hannah</hi> moved her Lips, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpread abroad his Hands, the Publican beat his Breaſt, and <hi>Christ</hi> fell upon the Ground. Sometimes 'tis expreſt by deep Sighs, and Groans, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. Sometimes by loud Crys, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3. Sometimes by often repeating the ſame Words, as in <hi>Chriſt, Mat.</hi> 26.30. And ſometimes by bitter Tears, as in <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 26.75. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Who in the days of his fleſh, when he had offered up Prayers and Supplications with ſtrong Crys and Tears,</hi> &amp;c. Yet this is not enough, we muſt alſo watch and pray, or watch in prayer, 'tis Chriſt's own Command. Now, Watching is the proper Act of the Body, 'tis but Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40419:69"/> Attributed to the Soul: Now, both are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; if the Body ſleep, the Soul cannot watch; and if the Soul ſnort in Security, Bodily Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiſe profite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> little. Watch that there be no ſin lying upon thy Conſcience, or Lived, or delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; that there be no paſſion predominant in the Soul, no Temptation of Satan entertained, no Worldly thoughts foiſted in to ſpoil thy Duty, no drouſineſs creeping upon thee; watch that thy Heart grow neither Cold nor Lazy, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, or ſteal away from the Duty; that Pride, nor ſelf appear there; that no roving Imagination, vain thoughts, or needleſs tautologies appear there: But above all, take heed thou come not in thine own ſtrength, but by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, perform the Duty which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this end, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Jude</hi> 20. Praying in the Holy Ghoſt, this illuminates the heart, diſcovers what is ſin, and what is Duty; what a Man is, what he hath, and what he wants; what a God he hath to deal with, what he requires, and worketh in us, both the will, and the Deed.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldeſt ſpeed well at the Throne of Grace, be ſure to demean thy ſelf well after the Duty; if thou miſcarry, then thou wilt loſe all thy Labour; think not that the Duty is over when thou art off thy Knees; no, there is good part behind: Call thy Heart to an Account, how it hath carried it ſelf in the Duty; if this were duly done, it durſt not wander, as it uſually doth, for fear of a check; and having found out it's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, be affected accordingly; if well, rejoyce, and bleſs God for it; it was he that kept it in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: If ill, check it, and make it ſmart for it,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40419:69"/> and ſtir it up by ſome rouſing Conſiderations. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine alſo what aſſiſtance thou haſt had from the Spirit of God, God promiſes the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, in the Inditing their prayers, and teaching them what to ask; if he have made good this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, bleſs God for it, and be encouraged by it for the future; and expect the fulfilling thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that the Spirit aſſiſted in the powring out: If thou haſt not met with this aſſiſtance, 'tis, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, thy own fault; for God never breaks his promiſe, if we keep the Condition; ſearch out the fault, and amend for the future; ſet Faith on work for the return of thy prayers, for no doubt, if thou prayeſt according to God's Will, thou ſhalt receive the Mercy prayed for. Many deal by their prayers, as fooliſh Children by their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; they ſhoot at Rovers, and mark not where they light: Moſt Men loſe their prayers, and heed not whether God hears them, or not; Anſwers them, or not; they make prayer the end of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and reſt ſatisfied, if the work be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out on Anſwer; they obſerve not where they light, or what comes of them. If thy Petition be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, expect an Anſwer; if it come, be ſure that which is gotten by prayer, be worn with Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; be not like the unthankful Lepers, go away, and let God hear no more of you. And when thou prayeſt againſt any ſin, be ſure to ſet Heart and Hand on work, to Mortifie that ſin. And when thou prayeſt for any Mercies, be ſure to Labour what thou canſt, in the uſe of means to attain that Mercy; 'tis a vain wiſh which is not ſeconded with endeavours: 'tis but a mocking of God, that will not be mocked; and a ridiculous thing to pray for that he will not endeavour for:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40419:70"/> As if a man ſhould pray to come to <hi>London,</hi> and will not ſet a ſtep that way. If thou prayeſt for Spiritual Bleſſings, uſe means to obtain them; and if for Temporal things, be diligent in the uſe of a Lawful Calling: 'tis the hand of the diligent that makes Rich. When thou prayeſt for thy Neighbour, be as willing to help him, to thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as to pray for him. Many men ſhew more Divinity in their Words, than Humanity in their Actions; one penny is more hardly got from them than thrice God help you. And when thou haſt put up thy Requeſts, then with patience wait for an Anſwer; as <hi>Hannah,</hi> when ſhe had poured out her Soul to God, ſhe depended upon him, and looked no more ſad, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. It may be, though God hath promiſed, and will perform; yet he will not give it at the firſt asking; he will make thee ſeek again, and wait alſo. When <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was in Priſon, and the Church prayed for his deliverance, it was the laſt Night, before God granted their Petitions, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5,6. But be it ſooner, or later, when the Mercy comes, give God his Tribute of praiſe; this he requires, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. And this was <hi>David</hi>'s practice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.2. And Chriſt chargeth this upon the <hi>Lepers,</hi> as their fault. If he deny thy Requeſt, ſeek out what is the cauſe, and, perhaps, thou maiſt find ſome ſin un-repented of, and then no wonder if God hear thee not; reſolve, with <hi>Saul,</hi> it ſhall dye, though it be thy <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.37. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that <hi>Achan</hi> that offends God, and troubles <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Or, perhaps, the Petition required is not ſutable; or thou failedſt either in the manner, or end: if ſo, be more wary the next time.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40419:70"/> Duty with ſtronger reſolutions, if prayer be not ſtrong enough, joyn Faſting: Some ſins, like ſome Devils, come not out but by prayer, and faſting. If thou canſt not do it thy ſelf, call in help; take theſe Directions, and thou wilt find the banefit of prayer.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Directions in, and about Singing of Pſalms.</head>
               <div type="introduction">
                  <p>THE Next Duty I ſhall Inſtruct you in, is Singing of Pſalms: A Duty much preſt, and practiſed, both in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Goſpel; and many thouſands of Believers have received benefit, and have been refreſhed by it. The Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, is of Divine Inſtitution. and compiled by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God: And though ſundry other pieces of Scripture, have been by ſeveral Perſons, in ſeveral Ages, called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, yet this was never Queſtioned by any. 'Tis expreſly mentioned by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 1.20. Yea, is acknowledged to be Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by Chriſt himſelf, the great Doctor of the Church, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.42. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>himſelf ſaith, in the Book of Pſalms, the Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand, till I make thine Enemies thy Foot-ſtool,</hi> Luke 24.44. <hi>All things muſt be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which were written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40419:71"/> in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms, concerning me.</hi> The Hebrew Title of this Book, is, <hi>Sepher Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hillim,</hi> a Book of Hymns, becauſe it chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in praiſe and thankſgiving unto God, for his benefits: And this Title ſeems to be taken from the Inſcription of the 145 Pſalm, where the word is uſed; and the whole Pſalm ſpends it ſelf in the praiſes of God. In the Scripture indeed, we read of Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. But what the difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe, is not eaſie to ſhew; no doubt, one, and the ſame Pſalm, may admit of either of theſe Names. Some have diſtinguiſhed them thus, Pſalms, ſay they, are thoſe that contain Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Holineſs, and Directions to an Holy Life: Hymns contain praiſes to God, for his benefits, Spiritual, and Temporal; and Spiritual Songs are a mixture of both. The Original word <hi>Mizmar,</hi> comes from a word that ſignifies cutting off ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things, and ſignifies a eompoſure of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious words, without Superfluity, or Exceſs; and 'tis ſufficient, that the whole Book, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral Subjects, is called by this one name, of Pſalms; even by Chriſt himſelf. Now, this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinance, or Holy Duty, though both Commanded; and Commended, and practiſed by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and the Church of God, even down from <hi>David</hi>'s Time, to this day; yet is denyed by ſome, and Queſtioned by others, to be a Duty; but I think they may Queſtion (as ſome indeed do) all the Ordinances, as well as this; for, what but the Ignorance, or wilful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of the Scripture, can be the ground of ſuch a denial? It may be indeed, they have never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this Duty as they ought to do, and ſo never
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40419:71"/> received that benefit and refreſhing from it, that others have done; and hence they judge it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and condemn the Ordinance for their own fault. But doubtleſs, many thouſands of Believers, may ſpeak out their Experiences, and tell you, they have been refreſhed by it. That it is a Chriſtian Duty, ſhall, God willing, be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewed you; and that 'tis both profitable and pleaſant, is eaſie to prove. The Pſalms are a Rich Store-Houſe of all manner of Proviſion; and thoſe that are converſant herein cannot be Ignorant of it. Here are Inſtructions for the Ignorant to lead them in the way to Heaven, and guide them by all the by-ways of Error, and Folly; here are Incitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the dull, and ſluggiſh, to rouſe them up out of the ſleep of Security. Here are prayers to draw down Mercies from God, and praiſes to God for Mercies received. What ſhall I ſay? Whatſoever Eſtate a Chriſtian can be in, here he may find Comfort, or Company, or both. Here, as in a Glaſs, are repreſented, and ſet forth, the thoughts, the words, and Actings of a gracious Soul, in every Condition; and the Experience they have had of God's help at hand, in every Condition: How oft doth the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> begin like <hi>Jonah</hi> in the belly of Hell? And is raiſed up to Heaven before the Concluſion. And 'tis wonder that any ſhould deſiſt from ſuch an Angelical duty, which ſo much reſembles Heaven: But becauſe many, no doubt, out of Conſcience, Queſtion the Duty: I ſhall firſt prove the Duty Lawful, and then give my Advice, how it may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldeſt perform this Duty acceptably to God, and profitably to thy ſelf, be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40419:72"/> well convinc'd that it is thy Duty; halt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Opinions, do it chearfully, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly; which thou canſt not do, ſo long as thou doubteſt whether it be thy Duty, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will own it at thy Hands; <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. To this End, view the Arguments following, which I ſuppoſe may be ſufficient to prove it thy Duty. My bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in this Treatiſe is not to meddle with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies; yet ſo far as the digreſſion may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and my Method and Deſign will allow, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething for thy Satisfaction. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore, God hath furniſhed Man for this Duty, in giving him this Muſical Faculty; with which, as with all the reſt, he ſhould Glorifie God: And how can he Glorifie him better with it, than with Trumpetting out his praiſe, and Singing forth his Glory? This is the way that <hi>David</hi> ſtirs up his Tongue to praiſe God. This was an acceptable Service unto God, even before the Ceremonial Law was given, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Then Sang</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>this Song unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. By this means alſo the Spirit of God is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18,19, <hi>Be filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſpeaking to your ſelves in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs.</hi> This leaves a ſweet reliſh and delight upon the Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.33,34. <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord as long as I Live; I will ſing unto my God while I have my Being; my Meditation of him ſhall be ſweet.</hi> Nay, this is that which Saints and Angels do in Heaven, and ſhall do for ever: Thus the Angels did, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 63. even with an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voice: As alſo of our Saviours Birth, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8,9. &amp; 14.3. &amp; 15.3. And this ſhall be their work for ever. Yea, it hath
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40419:72"/> been Propheſied, that there ſhall be Singing in Goſpel times, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20. <hi>In that day ſhall this Song be ſung.</hi> Iſa. 52.8. <hi>Thy Watch-men ſhall lift up the voyce, with the voyce together ſhall they Sing,</hi> &amp;c. Which the Apoſtle Interprets to be in Goſpel Times, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12. Yea, all Nations are ſtirred up to ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.12. Which includes both <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Goſpel Times, as 'tis Interpreted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. Neither can this Duty under the Law be Typical; for neither Scripture, nor Reaſon can ſhew, that Singing Pſalms Typified out a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Singing with the Heart in Goſpel Times, any more than prayer with the Voyce, Typifies out praying with the Heart. Nay, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> after his departure, would not have uſed it, had it been Ceremonial: If this ſerve not, we have plain Scripture Commands for the Duty, even in Goſpel Times, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Speaking to your ſelves in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, Singing with Melody in your Hearts,</hi> Col. 3.16. <hi>Teaching; and Admoniſhing one another, in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, ſinging with Grace in your Hearts to the Lord,</hi> James 4.9. <hi>If any be Afflicted, let him Pray; and if any be Merry, let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> Now, all this ſhews this is a Duty: If yet, this ſatisfie not, we have the beſt Examples, to warrant us. I ſhall ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the Angels, at the Birth of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13. And the Holy Men of God in the Time of the Law; <hi>David was called, The ſweet Singer of</hi> Iſrael: But this is not all; we have the Example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and his Diſciples, which is without Exception, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. <hi>After Supper they ſung an Hymn;</hi> which probably was the ſame
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40419:73"/> which the <hi>Jews</hi> were accuſtomed to ſing, at the Paſſeover, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe Songs of Degrees, from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112, &amp;c. to <hi>Pſal</hi> 118.19. However, this ſhews the Lawfulneſs of the Duty. We have alſo the Example of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> that Sang in the Priſon, with an Audible Voice, for the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners heard them, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.25. We have alſo the practice of the Church down ſince the Apoſtles Time; and all thoſe cannot likely perſiſt in an Error, ſo long: This we have for our Warrant, and little can be ſaid againſt it; and therefore I ſhall conclude 'tis a Lawful, and Laudable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>

                     </label> Is concerning the Matter of our Singing, which muſt be Holy, not Prophane; to God's Glory, &amp; not our own: There are many that think it is a Goſpel-Duty, to Sing Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, and yet they Scruple the Singing of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms; and thus they ſeek a knot in a Ruſh: <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms were an Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Service unto God; and we read not where ever God diſclaimed them: They were uſed, and Sung, not only by himſelf, but others; not only in his own Time, but in ſucceeding Generations; where they Praiſed God with <hi>David</hi>'s words: As we find in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13. In <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat</hi>'s Time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.21. In <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.20. In <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Time, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3.10,11. In the two former places, we find <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s words uſed; in the two latter we find an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command, and Example of Praiſing God with <hi>David</hi>'s words, and with the words of <hi>Aſaph:</hi> You ſee the eſtimate the Church of God put upon them; yea, as may be apparently proved, they were thus in uſe, even to Chriſt's Time, as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40419:73"/> Records, theſe Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> in the times of the Law, were ſung by the four and twenty Orders of Muſicians, which ſeem to Typifie out the Twenty four Elders, men ioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8. The Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Servant of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was Sung, not only by him, but by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; not only by Men, but Women alſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20,21. Yea, <hi>Moſes</hi> was Commanded to write his other Song, and teach it unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and put it into their Mouths, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19. And to what purpoſe was it thus written, and thus to be learnt, but that they ſhould ſing it? I have already proved we ought to Sing Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, the very Name gives unto <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms. Nay, there is ſtrong probability that Chriſt himſelf, when he was upon the Earth, Sang <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms at the cloſe of his Supper; for if he would conform to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to Sing an Hymn at the cloſe of the Paſſeover: What ground have we to think he did not conform to them in Singing the ſame Hymn, which they were wont to do: which was as hath been ſaid, <hi>David</hi>'s Hymns; however, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures make mention of no other. And 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Ancient Hebrew Copy of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>'s Goſpel gives favourable Light unto it, by making uſe of the word there, which is the Title unto <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms. We find alſo the Apoſtle Pen'd good part of the Second Pſalm, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24. and why not Sing it? And if Chriſt, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had had any other Hymns, they would have been left upon Record, as ſome of their Prayers are; but no ſuch thing is to be found. Nay, we read that the Angels themſelves, in their Coeleſtial Harmony, conforming themſelves to the words
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40419:74"/> of <hi>David,</hi> and allude unto the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Servant of the Lord; and therefore, doubtleſs, 'tis not unlawful for us to do thus. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we are Commanded to ſing in the Spirit, and ſo we may, if we uſe a Form indited by the Spirit, and Sing them with the Heart, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: We are Commanded to Pray by the Spirit; and can any Imagine, but ſo we may, though we uſe the Form Chriſt hath bid us uſe. But if we expect an immediate impulſe of the Spirit; dictating to us both ſenſe, and Meeter, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting words into our Mouths as we ſing; not one of a thouſand, if ever any at all, will be found to have ſuch a gift. Indeed, in the Apoſtles days, when extraordinary gifts were given, ſome ſuch thing might be, which now cannot be expected, any more than the gift of Healing: And ſeeing that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> Men endued with the Spirit, Pen their Songs for the Publick good; let us be contented to ſee by their Light, and not preſume to compare with them, much leſs, to exceed them: We may find ſpecial Pſalms appointed upon ſpecial occaſions; as for the Sabbath day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Book of Pſalms is ſo perfect a Sentence, that there needs no Addition; and if it did, doubtleſs, God would have ditected ſome to have perfected the work; 'tis a great boldneſs for any man not indued with the Spirit of God, to thruſt upon the Church an Hymn of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and lay aſide thoſe indited by the Spirit: If we muſt Sing, it muſt be <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, or worſe; I think no humble man will compare the beats of his own brain with the immediate impulſes of the Spirit: I know not what Warrant we have to leave the one, to uſe the other.</p>

'Tis eaſily granted, that a godly Man, for his own ſolace, may ſing alone; and thus <hi>David</hi> did his Night-Songs upon his Bed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6. And 'tis evident alſo in the Primitive Times, when the gift of Tongues was in uſe, and other extraordinary gifts, which now are ceaſed: One that had a <hi>Pſalm</hi> given by Divine Inſpiration, might, and did Sing alone, and the reſt joyned, as afore-ſaid, and ſaid Amen to it: For it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and improbable, that all ſhould ſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by ſuch a Divine rapture. But this gift failing, and <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms</hi> Lawful; yea, the beſt we have, or can have: The whole Church may joyn in theſe, not only in Heart, but in Voice: I think this need not be controverted. God, that is the God of Order, and never eſtabliſhed, or owned Confuſion, hath formerly owned this, as I have ſhewed: Where Prieſts, and People; Men, and Women, joyned together, as in <hi>Moſes</hi> Song, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The whole Church of <hi>Coloſs</hi> was exhorted hereunto, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. And not the Paſtours, and Select Elders only: And if God would have ſuch Select Choriſters for this Work in Goſpel Times, he would have given Inſtructions, and Directions for their Qualification, and Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he hath done for other Officers, beſides ſome Miniſters otherwiſe Godly, and able, are
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40419:75"/> not fitted for this Duty, neither have they ſuch a Muſical Faculty, as to be fit to be the Mouth of the People in this Duty: And God hath indued many of the People in this, beyond their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and doubtleſs, it is not given in vain: <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Sang together, <hi>Ex.</hi> 15.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, in Goſpel Times, <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples, Mat.</hi> 26.30. The like we read of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas;</hi> and why ſhould we doubt that have ſuch Leaders? I know not. The Angels that were ten thouſand times ten thouſand: yea, thouſands of thouſands, joyned together without Confuſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11,12. But you will ſay, here is no Expreſſion of Singing: See then thoſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty and four Thouſand, that followed the Lamb; thoſe ſang a new Song, which no other could Learn, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1.3. And this ſhall be the Saints work for ever. But ſome queſtion whether Women may ſing in the Church, and think they have cauſe enough for their doubt, becauſe the Apoſtle doth peremptorily forbid a Woman to ſpeak in the Church; but ſhe cannot ſing, but ſhe muſt ſpeak, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 34. But this is grounded upon a miſtake: Indeed, they ought not to ſpeak by way of Office, or Publick Teaching, but muſt be under the Authority of her Husband: Neither to make Queſtions there, but at Home, leſt they tranſcend the bounds of Modeſty; but that they muſt not ſpeak at all, will not be proved. <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> ſpake, when <hi>Peter</hi> demanded her Anſwer. Nay, then they muſt not ſay Amen, to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a Duty enjoyned to all in general. We read of <hi>Miram,</hi> and the Women, they Sang, and were not reproved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20,21. And that it was the practice in the Primitive Times, for Men
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40419:75"/> and Women to Sing together: The Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory may inform you. But ſome Men doubt whether Carnal Men and Women ought to Sing, or whether Chriſtians ought to joyn with them, if they do; and the reaſon is, they think hereby they hold Fellowſhip with them: But what Reaſon is there that a Man may pray in a mixt Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not ſing, when as this is but a more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate ſort of Prayer; the Voice is Natural, the Tune Artificial; ſo far we may joyn, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is common to both: And for the Manner, if they ſing Spiritually, then they are fit to be joyned with; if not, what Spiritual Communion have we with them? No queſtion, but it is their Duty, and why may we not joyn with a Man doing his Duty? <hi>Moſes</hi> Sang with a Rebellious People, and God Commanded him to write his Song, as a Witneſs againſt them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19. And there is no Pſalm, but every one in the Congregation may Learn ſome Inſtruction from it, and make ſome good uſe of it.</p>

'Tis true, we have no Command, <hi>toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem verbis,</hi> for ſo doing; no more have we for the Tranſlation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But doubtleſs, if <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> ought to ſtudy the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and read it, 'tis neceſſary that it be Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Language they underſtand. If <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms may, and ought to be Sung by <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> it is to be Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or how
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40419:76"/> can they Sing with the Underſtanding? And why ſhould it not be Sung in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner; which is, when 'tis fitted with apt meaſure, ſyllables, and Meeter, as <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> uſe in their Songs; and not only them, but alſo other Nations. If it be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Tranſlate the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible into Proſe, in reference to Reading; why not into Meeter, in reference to Singing? As for the former, I know none but the Papiſts that deny it; who would thereby keep the People in Ignorance, that their own Jugling ſhould not be ſpied: But doubtleſs, if this Command of Searching the Scriptures, and letting the Word of God dwell plentifully in us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belong to <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> they muſt be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, that they may be able to do it, which not one of a thouſand could do in the Original Language. Now, God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to Sing Pſalms, as well as Read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which very few are able to do, ſo long as they are lockt up in the Original <hi>Hebrew;</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tranſlation is neceſſary: And that they ſhould be fitted with ſuch Meaſures, and quantity of Syllables as is neceſſary to make them fit to be Sung the more Melodiouſly, by <hi>Engliſh men.</hi> I know not why any ſhould deny this; for why may not <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verſe, and Meeter, be turned into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe, and Meeter, I ſee not; as well as <hi>Hebrew</hi> Proſe into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proſe? In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> they are fitted to be Sung, and Poetically Compiled; and many Verſes together in ſome Pſalms are in Meeter, as the Skilful in the Tongue affirm; as <hi>Buxtorfius,</hi> in his <hi>Theſaurus,</hi> and others. And why ſhould not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have their manner of Singing, as well as the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? And why ſhould not the Tranſlators preſerve
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40419:76"/> the Elegancy of the Original Language? Which they cannot do, if they ſhould let ſlip, and neglect thoſe Poetical Fancies, Accents, Tones, and Tunes, which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> kept; and with which the Pſalms, and other Poetical parts of Scripture are pen'd: And therefore Poetry is no Humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but uſed by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, in the Penning of the Scripture; and may, no doubt, be uſed Lawfully by the Tranſlator alſo. But thoſe, that by a Common, and Ordinary gift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Pſalms, and Hymns; both for Matter, and Manner, this is a Humane Invention; eſpecially if impoſed upon the Church, or read ſuddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſideration be had before, by the Church; whether they are according to the Scripture, yea, or no. Nay, the Tranſlating of the Scripture may as well be called an Humane Invention as this. Neither can it be called an Humane Impoſition, when none are compelled to Sing, nor no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned for the neglect. But ſome will ſay, the Tranſlation is full of Errors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot joyn in the Duty: Alas! what can be done of Man, but it will appear to be done by Man? The beſt Tranſlation of the Scriptures is not without its faults; and ſhall we therefore uſe none? When Men do their endeavour, God takes the Will for the Deed. The <hi>Septuagint</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation is abundantly faulty, as the Learned know; and often varies from the <hi>Hebrew-Text:</hi> Yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles make uſe of it. Nay, in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Copy, as 'tis obſerved in the Old Teſtament, there are 800. divers Readings; and in the <hi>Greek</hi> Teſtament, above a Thouſand. God hath, 'tis true, promiſed to keep his word to a tittle, but not in this, or that Copy, or Tranſlation, but in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40419:77"/> the whole; we have the whole. Some ſay, that Tranſlating it into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meeter, there is often adding to, and taking from, contrary to God's abſolute Command, <hi>Deut</hi> 12. <hi>laſt.</hi> But conſider, here is no Addition, but an Explication; no Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty added, only the words altered, the ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; and a Tranſlation may admit of ſuch a Cavil, and all Expoſitions will hereby come under the Reproof: You may as well ſay, that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, opening, and applying Scripture, is adding to it; for here are more words uſed: Thus you ſee none have need to Scruple the Duty.</p>

                     </label> As concerning the Tune, wherein thoſe Scripture Pſalms are to be ſung; for in this alſo is ſome Controverſie: For ſome charge it to be a Humane Inſtitution, foiſted into God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. To this, I ſay, I ſhall add thus much: That ſeeing God hath Commanded us to Sing with the Underſtanding, which muſt needs be, not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; and he gives us no Direction concerning the Tune, wherein we muſt Sing. By this 'tis apparent, 'tis beſt to our own choice, ſo that we tranſgreſs not againſt that general Direction, given in the Word, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in Order.</hi> An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pſalm may, doubtleſs, have an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tune, ſo that it be grave, decent, and comely; not lite, wanton, or frothy; but ſuch as becomes ſo Holy a Majeſty, and is ſuitable to ſo grave a Matter. It appears plainly by <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and others, that in their Times, <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms were put into Songs, for their Edification; and <hi>Euſebius</hi> Reports of ſome rejecting thoſe, uſed ſuch Songs in the Church, as would make Men afraid to hear them. The <hi>Jews,</hi> 'tis confeſſed, had their peculiar
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40419:77"/> Tunes, and Accents; either ſet down by the Pen-man, or added by the Singer; but theſe are hid from us, and I ſuppoſe, fully known by no man Living; and the little that remains cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſion: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that God hath given us a Language different from theirs, and ſuffered us to ſerve him with words different from the words they ſerved him with. So likewiſe hath he given us Tunes and Tones different from theirs, and no doubt, will accept of them at our hands. Every Nation and Language hath ſome proper and peculiar Dialect of their own, and yet God accepts of all where the Heart is right: And as he hath given us Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Pray to him in our own words, which we may gather from the Anſwers, and Returns which many have of their Prayers. So likewiſe, no doubt, he will accept of our Praiſes, in our own Tunes; which appears alſo by the Refreſhings, which many have found in this Duty. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath appointed the ſubſtance of his Worſhip, and left the Circumſtances to Humane Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he hath Commanded the Preaching of the Word, but for the Time, and Place, and other Circumſtances, he determined not. In the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he appoints what Meat to eat, but left it to their own choice, whether to drink Wine, or water, or any other Liquor. So ſinging of Pſalms are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, but in what Tune, he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, any further than the general Directions, of <hi>decently, and in Order</hi> reach. <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tunes, as I ſaid, are much unknown; and if known, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree with our Language; no more do ours with other Languages. Now, if we ſing, it muſt be in ſome Tune, but no Tune being peculiarly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40419:78"/> our own, no doubt, may be Lawfully uſed. Neither can it be juſtly called an innovation thruſt into God's Worſhip, any more than the Word Tranſlated out of the Original into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in which the Scriptures are Read; yet this is held to be Lawful. 'Tis Invention indeed, which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of nothing but of the Wit, or Will of Man, thruſt into God's Service, and is not agreeable to the Rule, this may be ſuſpected, and rejected; but this is not of that Nature: The Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, is, what Reaſon can be given why we may not uſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tunes, as well as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Words, in God's Worſhip; ſeeing the one is as Conſonant to Scripture, and Reaſon, as the other. Another ſcruple that ſome make upon the like ground, is, the reading of the Pſalm, in Order to ſinging. Indeed, were all men able to repeat the Pſalms without Book; or had all thoſe, to whom ſinging is a Duty, the gift of Reading; or were furniſhed with Books to Read, this were not neceſſary; but till this comes to paſs, which will never be, Reading is of uſe; the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is to ſing, and unleſs all were thus Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, how can they ſing, if it be not read? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf dictates to us, we muſt uſe means to bring to the end, and the Scripture never denies it. Now, this is a good means for Inſtruction, and why may we not receive Inſtruction by the Ear, in Hearing, as well as by the Eye, in Reading. In Prayer, we think it more convenient to joyn with the Miniſter, hearing him, than if we could read the ſame Prayer along with him in a Book. When all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſang together with <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is like it was read to them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for doubtleſs, all had not Copies of it, if they could
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40419:78"/> have read, neither had committed it to Memory. Neither can the Reading of it any way hinder the Melody, neither will it hinder, but help the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, neither any way dull the Affections: And thus I hope I have removed thoſe Objections, and Anſwered the doubts of thoſe that ſcruple this Ordinance.</p>

Many a man loſeth much Labour, and pains, and ſpends much Time to little purpoſe; an evident Example we have in the <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 6.1,2, &amp;c. who Faſted, Prayed, and gave Alms; all Excellent Duties: But thoſe Sacrifices, though otherwiſe good, being mixt with the Dung of their own ſelf-ſeeking, and deſire of popular applauſe, God throws it back into their Faces, as Dung, without a Reward; and ſo it will be with thee, if thou ſeek thy ſelf, and not God, in the Duty: If Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Credit, or a deſire of Popular Applauſe, drive thee on to this Duty, and not the ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of God's Glory, thou maiſt expect thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from Men, and not from God. Many Men in Singing Pſalms, aim at no higher End, nor make any better uſe of it, than they do in their Prophane Songs, or Ungodly Ballads, <hi>viz.</hi> Their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, to drive away the Time, or a deſire to be Applauded for their good Voice, or Tune, or Excellent gift in Singing. But the chief End which every Chriſtian ſhould aim at in all his Actions, eſpecially in all his Acts of Divine Worſhip, ſhould
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40419:79"/> be God's Glory, and his own Souls good; if this be laid aſide, thou maiſt expect a Curſe, and not a Bleſſing upon thy proceedings. If this be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Duty is ſpoyled; if this be minded, God will accept of it, though accompanied with many Imperfections. This Heavenly Duty is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to this End, by the Angels, and the whole Church Triumphant, as before is ſhewed, and will be the Work of Eternity; and here upon Earth, if Heart and Voice go together: 'Tis a reſemblance of Heaven, and repreſents, though darkly, that Melodious Harmony that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, amongſt thoſe Glorious Choriſters. We ſhould make Melody in our Hearts, and not only with our Mouths. Look upon it as a part of God's Worſhip, and Service, and appointed for Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Conſolation, not for Prophane Recreation; and therefore we ſhould, with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> ſay, <hi>Not unto us, Lord; not to us, but to thine own Name be the Glory.</hi> Let us work for God, and he will not fail to give us a Reward; and there is great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould in this Duty Trumpet out his Praiſe, for all we have is his, and from his hand it is we receive every good and perfect gift: We have our Life, and Being from him, and have no more breath than what he puts into us; and there is all the Reaſon we ſhould render to him the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes due for all: And this is one way we have to Praiſe him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. Thus the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men of Old have gone before us, and aimed at this very End. Thus <hi>Deborah,</hi> and <hi>Barak; Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> and many more; and thus <hi>David</hi> reſolves to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.17. <hi>I will Sing praiſe to the Name of the Lord moſt High,</hi> Pſal. 111.1.

Now, this Duty, though it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerns the Godly, as thoſe that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the moſt, and greateſt Mercies, and have the greateſt abilities for the Work; yet others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo having received all they have from God, are alſo obliged to render Praiſe, and Thanks to God, and are frequently called upon, thus to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. where all Nations are excited to this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And as God's Glory is chiefly to be minded, ſo our own Benefit is not to be neglected, and our Souls good.

A good Duty may be ſpoyled by the ill doing it, as well as a good Tool by ill handling. The Duty we Treat of is not ſo eaſie, as many think it is: Many care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly performing it, and finding little benefit by it, have miſtruſted the Duty, rather than themſelves; like the Maid in <hi>Pliny,</hi> that being ſuddenly ſtruck Blind in the Night, blames the Sun the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for not Riſing. Men are apt to accuſe any thing; yea, God himſelf, rather than themſelves: Becauſe they themſelves feed upon the Husks, they think there is none that taſte the Kirnel; and ſo lay it aſide, and plead againſt it. But upon the ſame grounds many of them plead themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ordinances, and reſt not, till they plead perfection; and look upon Ordinances as beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rudiments; but to leave theſe to their ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. When thou approacheſt to God in this Ordinance, being part of his Inſtituted Worſhip, be ſure to bring thy Heart along with thee, and ingage it in the Duty. God ſaith of the Heart, as ſometimes <hi>Joſeph</hi> did of his Brother <hi>Benjamin;</hi> you ſhall not ſee my Face, if your Brother <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> be not with you: You ſhall not ſee his Face, if
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40419:80"/> the Heart be abſent. Heart and Voyce muſt joyn together, or it will make no pleaſing Melody in the Ears of God: <hi>He is a Spirit, and muſt be Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> For, as Fervent Prayer may prevail, where cold Petitions are denyed: So hearty Praiſes are acceptable, when others are eſteemed but as a mocking of God. We muſt ſing with the Affection, and with the Underſtanding alſo: The whole bent of the Soul muſt be ſet upon the work; the Blind, and the Lame, and the Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sacrifice is abominable unto God. My Son, ſaith he, <hi>Give me thy Heart.</hi> Whatever thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt without the Heart, he will have none of it: The more of the Heart is in the Duty, the better he loves it. Thou muſt ſing with the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. Thus <hi>David,</hi> when he began to ſing, lift up, not only his Voyce, but his Soul to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. and calls upon all that is within him to bleſs the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1. And we have Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to this Duty, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. The Lowing of an Ox, the Grunting of a Hog, make as Melodious an Harmony in God's Ears as a Heartleſs Prayer, or Praiſe. God is a Spirit, and muſt be Worſhipped in Spirit, and in Truth: Nay, it muſt not be only with the Heart, but with the Heart rightly Qualified: An ungracious Heart cannot but ſavour ſtrong in the Noſtrils of God, worſe than a ſtinking Carrion doth in ours: we muſt ſing with Grace in our Hearts, as the former Scriptures plainly teſtifie. Sincerity is neceſſary; approach not near him, without the Wedding-Garment: Hypocriſie ſpoyls all thy beſt Actions; we may as well expect ſweet Water in a dirty Channel, or ſtinking puddle, as a good Duty from a rotten Heart. The Graces of the Spirit muſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40419:81"/> adorn that Soul, that muſt be welcom into God's preſence: Neither is it ſufficient, that they be there in the Habit, but they muſt be drawn forth into the Act; for, as we muſt Pray, and Sing with the Underſtanding, and Affection, ſo we muſt Pray, and Sing with Faith, believing thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made by God, and thoſe Petitions put up, that they ſhall be in Time Anſwered. Bring Hope along alſo, to wait for the Accompliſhment, and Love to God, and Delight in his Service, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his Glory, and other ſuitable Graces: And thus doing, expect a Bleſſing upon the Ordinance, and benefit by it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. Directions in Obſerving the Sabbath Day.</head>
                  <p>THE next Duty I ſhall Treat of, is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sabbath Day, for this alſo is a Commanded Duty; this is that ſtated time for the Worſhip of God, and neceſſary for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. For if we muſt Worſhip God in ſome place, ſo ſome time is alſo required for this Worſhip: and God himſelf hath appointed out what he thinks moſt ſuitable, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8. <hi>Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, to keep it Holy,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned it to be obſerved upon pain of Death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.2. <hi>Whoſoever doth work therein ſhall be put to Death.</hi> And we read of the Man, that gathering ſticks upon that Day, was by God's ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be put to Death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.32. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there are many that eaſily grant, it was a Duty obliging the <hi>Jews,</hi> but not the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and is of no force at preſent to Chriſtians, but Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo aboliſhed with the Ceremonial Law; but for Satisfaction know, ſomething in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was Ceremonial, and that ceaſeth; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Moral, and that remaineth. Nature it ſelf teacheth us that there is a God; and the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth, that this God is to be Worſhipped; and Reaſon tells us, ſome time muſt be alotted for this Worſhip: God appoints one day of ſeven, for this Work, and that is Moral; but what ſeventh day, whether from the Creation, or no,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40419:82"/> is left to God to determine. Many that know not the true God, yet alot ſome time for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their Imagined Deities; but that it muſt be this, or that day, Nature teaches not, but is alterable at God's diſpoſe, but not at Mans; and that it was obſerved in Remembrance of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> was Ceremonial, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. And Typified out a deliverance by Chriſt, a Reſt in him, and his Reſting in the Grave. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the rigid Obſervation of it, enjoyned to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they muſt not go out of their places, kindle a Fire, dreſs any Meat, bear any burthen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon it. Chriſtian Liberty hath freed us from this; but for the Obſervation of one day in ſeven, for God's Service, is Commanded by God, approved by Chriſt, and practiſed by the Apoſtles, and all ſucceeding Generations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. and what power on Earth, then can make it void? It was a Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, before there was any Ceremony uſed, or enjoyned, or any Saviour needed, or promiſed. I ſay, for the Subſtance of it, though it was afterwards preſt more ſtrictly, and ſome Ceremonies added to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and therefore it belongeth to all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though the Ceremonial part concerned them only; and though we read not that it was Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in thoſe firſt Ages, yet it follows not, that it was not, when many thouſand things then done could not be expreſſed in ſo ſhort a Hiſtory: Yea, the ſame ſeems to be known to the <hi>Jews</hi> before the Law was given, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23, &amp;c. <hi>To Morrow is the Reſt of the Holy Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. When it was after that God gave it in the Command; and if this Reſt upon the ſeventh day be Ceremonious, why not the Command of Labour on the ſix other
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40419:82"/> days alſo? And why doth not this ceaſe to be a Duty as well as the other, and then the idleſt Perſons may be the beſt Chriſtians? We may find this Command reaches even to the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is within the Gates, when I think the Ceremonies are not preſt upon them. Many Reaſons alſo are given in the Command, which belong to us, as well as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as from the Equity of it: God, who is the Diſpoſer of all, gives us Six days, and reſerves one to himſelf, which he calls his own; <hi>The Sabbath of the Lord thy God:</hi> And Chriſt tells us, <hi>The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath;</hi> and from his own Example; he Reſted, and therefore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to Reſt; the End was, to Worſhip God in it, and to Dedicate it to his Service, for the Reſting of Man and Beaſt upon it; and diſtinguiſhing his People from others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and doth not this concern us as well as the <hi>Jews?</hi> God requires no leſs proportion of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice now, than he did then, and therefore no leſs time to do it in. Our Bodies require as much Reſt as theirs, and our Souls as much Food; and why ſhould not we have the like time? And this being the Subſtance of the Fourth Command, I think neither Man, nor Angel, can alter it; for who can proportion it better than God himſelf? Nay, the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the delivering of this Law, ſhews to be Moral. It was ſpoken by God's Mouth, as well as the other; written by the ſame Finger of God, in the ſame Tables of Stone, put into the Ark, where the Ceremonies were
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40419:83"/> not; it hath a ſpecial <hi>Memento</hi> put upon it: <hi>Remember the Sabbath, to keep it Holy.</hi> Chriſt himſelf owns it, when he bids the <hi>Jews</hi> Pray that their Flight be not in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.20. which Flight was forty Years after his Death. The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which wicked Men make againſt it, proves it to be of God alſo; for if the Devil herein prevail, we might almoſt bid farewel to all our Religion.</p>

                     </label> Before thou canſt make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Obſerving the Sabbath, thou muſt be well convinc'd that it is thy Duty. To this End I have already proved it to be of Divine Inſtitution, and a Branch of the Moral Law; binding, not only <hi>Jews,</hi> but Chriſtians alſo. But I fore-ſee one main rub muſt be removed, before the way be cleared; that doubt which makes many to ſtumble: Whether the firſt day of the Week, or that which we call the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sabbath, be of Divine Inſtitution; and whether Chriſtians be obliged to obſerve it as a Sabbath. Much hath been Written by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to ſatisfie this doubt: My purpoſe is not to ſpeak much to it in this place, this Treatiſe being of another Nature, yet ſomething is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for while this doubt remains, who will make uſe of the following Directions? 'Tis true, we cannot prove in Scripture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſaid, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> that Chriſt did Command that the Sabbath ſhould be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the laſt, to the firſt day of the week, then there could be no Controverſie; but we
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40419:83"/> have that which is equivalent to ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that it was changed by Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and very probably by Chriſt himſelf; the Scripture yields us ſufficient Witneſs Chriſt is called the Lord of the Sabbath, and the Holy Ghoſt calls it his day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. which ſeems to intimate, he is the Author of it: As the Sacrament is called his Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he Inſtituted it; and had it not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by him, I know not who would have been ſo bold, to have diſtinguiſhed it from other days by this Name; he was every way as Faithful in his Houſe as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, yet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> we know, by God's appointment, ſtated a time for God's Worſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2.6. and no doubt, a ſettled time is as neceſſary for us, as for them, to Serve God in. We find Chriſt himſelf owning the day in his own Perſon; as in his Reſurrection, and finiſhing the work of our Redemption, a greater work than that of Creation, and better deſerves a ſpecial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial: And the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>He entred into his Reſt, and ceaſed from his own Work, as God did from his,</hi> Heb. 4.10. aluding to the Creation, from which, when God Reſted, he Ordained the Sabbath. We may alſo Read, that Chriſt, after his Reſurrection, appeared divers times to his Diſciples upon the firſt day of the Week, when they were met together; Read <hi>John</hi> 2.19. and again, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. And doubtleſs, not without Divine Providence pointing out this day to us; and after his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, when they were met together upon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40419:84"/> that day, he pours out the Holy Ghoſt upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.12. We Read alſo, that this was the day the Apoſtles did keep as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and alſo the Churches met together to perform Sabbath days duties; to Preach the Word, to Adminiſter the Sacraments, Prayer, Works of Charity, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 18.2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt day of the Week let every one of you lay by in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him</hi> And as 'tis conceived, forty Years after Chriſts Deceaſe, Saint <hi>John,</hi> by the Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt, calls it the Lord's day, whereupon he received his Revelation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. Neither do we Read, that the Apoſtles ever kept any other day, as a Sabbath; 'tis true indeed, upon the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath they often Preached, taking Advantage of the Multitude then gathered together, which Advantage at other times they wanted. Now, if the change were thus made by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, it was by the directions of the Spirit of God; for the Apoſtles delivered but what they had received from God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. It was upon this day they met to Preach, and break Bread, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1,2. Now, were there no Precept, the conſtant Example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Churches in the Apoſtles time, may ſatisfie us, for they were Inſpired by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and appointed them both by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Example to Teach his Church; and to this End gave them Inſtructions in the time between his Reſurrection, and Aſcention, which Inſtructions are not all Recorded; yea,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40419:84"/> the conſtant practice of the Church in all Ages ſince the Apoſtles time, give us no little Light; for though Chriſtians have been at great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among themſelves about other matters, yet few queſtioned the change of the day; both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> both <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calveniſts,</hi> hold to this, and God's Bleſſing upon their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours is great encouragement; he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſucceed them in ſo ſinful a Courſe, were it ſuch; nay, the remarkable Judgments of God upon Sabbath-breakers, beſpeakes God for the Author, for none in the World could Lawfully have done it without him. Thus I have ſhewn you, I hope, ſufficient grounds to Build upon; I proceed now to Direct you to keep it as a Sabbath.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldſt Faithfully San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Sabbath, as God Commands thee, make preparation for it before it come; for there is hardly any thing of great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment well done without ſome preparation, and much more here: we prepare the Body for Phyſick, before we take it; we provide in Summer for Winter, and lay in Proviſion in Harveſt; we prepare in the Day for the Night, and work when we have the Light: We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare in Health for Sickneſs, and in Youth for Age: And were we to appear before ſome great Man, we ſhould make preparation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and ſhall we only be wanting in the Service of our Lord, and Maſter, and ruſh into his Preſence without prepared Hearts?
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40419:85"/> God bids us remember the Sabbath day, to keep it Holy, or to Sanctifie it, as 'tis, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.12. The word Remember, ſignifies either to call to mind ſomething paſt, or to commit to Memory ſomething for the Future, and both are neceſſary to this buſineſs. God ſets this <hi>Memento</hi> upon it, to Teach us, that thoſe that will keep it well, when it is come, muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it before it come, or otherwiſe our Nature is ſo Corrupt, that it will take hold upon ſome Occaſion or other to draw us aſide from the Duty in hand: We can fore-caſt for Fairs, and Markets, ſometimes long before, and make preparations for them according to our needs, whether to buy or ſell: We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our wants to have them ſupplyed, and make preparations accordingly; and yet how few make preparation for the Market day for the Soul. Many tire themſelves in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of their Calling in the Week days, and then uſe the Lord's day no otherwiſe than a Beaſt, only Reſt from their Labours; for their Spirits being ſpent, and their Bodies tyred, they are more fit for ſleep, than any Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ruſhing rudely out of the World, into the Service of God, they bring ſo much of the world with them, that it renders them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Spiritual Duty. But thy Care ſhould be, to ſequeſter thy Heart, Thoughts, and Affections from the world, and ſet them upon God; and empty thy Heart of worldly Cares, and Troubles, that thou maiſt mind the buſineſs God ſets thee about. The want
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40419:85"/> of this is one Cauſe why Men get ſo little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the Ordinances; and hear ſo much, and profit ſo little, becauſe they come not with empty Hearts; a full Veſſel can receive no more, when the Prophet multiplied the Widdows Oyl, when there was no more empty Veſſels, the Oyl ſtayed: When the Head and Heart are full of the World, this Water of Life will run over. But our Duty is to prepare the Heart for ſo great a work, as the Entertaining our Lord, and Maſter, the great God of Heaven and Earth, who invites himſelf to Sup with us: He is the Searcher of the Heart, and the Tryer of the Reins. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabbath come, uſe ſuch fore-ſight, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and Meditation; and diſpoſe, and ſeaſonably diſpatch thy Worldly buſineſs, that thou maiſt be more free, and fit for the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the day. We find <hi>Iſrael</hi> did thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to Sanctifie the Sabbath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.22. and gathered <hi>Manna</hi> enough the day before; and this was uſual among the <hi>Jews, Luke</hi> 23.54. <hi>And that day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.</hi> Thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prepared againſt the Sabbath, that it ſhould not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.19. And Gods Example in this is binding to us; he finiſhed his works before, and ſo ſhould we, and ſhould not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any unneceſſary Worldly buſineſs then, either with Hand, or Heart, that our Duties be not peſtered with the World; but that we may be as free to ſerve the Lord, if poſſible, as if we had no worldly buſineſs to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40419:86"/> look to; but many fore-caſt buſineſs for that day, or make it neceſſary through their former neglects; but this will appear to be their Sin, and their Folly. <hi>Solomon</hi> bids us <hi>look well to our Feet,</hi> viz. our Affections, <hi>when we go into the Houſe of God,</hi> Eccl. 5.1. And 'tis good to conſider whoſe Preſence we come into; and, with Holy <hi>David,</hi> waſh our Hands in Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, before we compaſs his Altars, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.6. Examine how the Caſe ſtands between God and thy Soul, and venture not into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in an unregenerate Condition, or having ſin unmortified, or unrepented of, leſt he break thee in pieces, and there be none to deliver thee. Conſider what ſin thou haſt Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, eſpecially in the week paſt, and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them; lay aſide thy worldly buſineſs betime on the Eve; when others only ſweep their Houſes, do thou ſweep thy Heart: Set ſome time apart for Reading, Meditating, Conferring, Inſtructing thy Family, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them; reconcile the Differences, if there be any in the Family; between Husband and Wife, Parent and Child, Maſter and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; yea, Neighbour and Neighbour, that your Prayers be not hindred; for God can hardly be well ſerved, where the Members of a Family Live at Diſcord. In a word, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy Heart to meet God the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     </label> Wouldſt thou Sanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? Take heed thou do nothing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful upon that day. This is appointed by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40419:86"/> God for a day of reſt; and not only, as ſome ſay, from ſin, which ſhould be Committed no day, but alſo from Labour, which at other times is Lawful, the works of our Calling; yea, unneceſſary recreations are forbidden, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.10. <hi>In it thou ſhalt do no manner of Work, thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter; thy Man-Servant, nor thy Maid-Servant, thy Cattle, nor the Stranger that is within thy Gates.</hi> Jer. 17.21,22. <hi>Neither do ye any work, but Hallow the Sabbath day,</hi> &amp;c. Neither will a bare ceſſation from work ſerve the turn, for reſt is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for an Higher End, that we might ſerve God with more Freedom; and therefore Idleneſs is a ſin worſe than Bodily Labour, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that day; and when Men uſe not reſt as a means, but as an End, 'tis an egregious breach of the Fourth Command; and 'tis a groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to think, that is an acceptable Duty, on that day, which is a great ſin any day. He that keeps the Sabbath only by reſting from his Labour, keeps it but as a Bruit Beaſt; yet the moſt of Men ſpend great part of the day in Idleneſs, or what is worſe; and think, if they give God their Bodily Preſence for an hour, or two, it's ſufficeable; but God will not be mocked: we ſhould think it were an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Servant that would work but two or three hours in the day. God gives us ſix whole days for our work, and ſhall not we give him one whole one for his? well, reſt we muſt from our Labour, but that is not all; we muſt ſpend it in God's Service: we muſt forbear
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40419:87"/> our work, that we may do his, and beware of all that hinders us; and that is not only our work, but our pleaſures and recreations, works of our Calling we are forbidden, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of Death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.15. <hi>He that doth any work upon it ſhall ſurely be put to Death:</hi> And God meant as he ſpake, we find that he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the man that gathered ſticks on the Sabbath day to be put to Death, and he was ſtoned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.36. And there is great reaſon, for how can a man ſerve God, when Heart and Hand, when his Thoughts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are intangled in the world? How can he ſerve two Maſters, but he muſt ſleight the one? when the Body is indiſpoſed by Labour, how can the Heart be free? And God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Heart; My Son, give me thy Heart. Neither will he have a divided Heart, he will have all, or none; and he Commands not only our ſelves, but alſo our Children, and Servants; yea, even the Bruit Beaſts to reſt from their Labour, that our Hearts may be the freer, and there be no occaſion for roving thoughts, and to avoid diſtraction in God's Service. Recreations alſo, except thoſe that are purely neceſſary, are alſo forbidden, even thoſe which are at other times Lawful; ſports and paſtimes are no leſs dangerous than work; yea, much more, for they draw away the Heart more than honeſt Labour. <hi>Auguſtine thought it was more Lawful to Plough on the Lord's day, than to Dance;</hi> but many of our wanton Youth are of another mind; but the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40419:87"/> one brings Profit, the other oft tends to the debauching of Youth: And doubtleſs, God himſelf hath forbidden theſe vain paſtimes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. <hi>If thou turn thy Feet from the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, doing thy Pleaſure on my Holy day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and call the Sabbath a delight, the Holy of the Lord, Honourable, and ſhalt Honour him; not doing thy own ways, nor finding thy own Pleaſures, nor ſpeaking thy own words,</hi> &amp;c. Worldly and vain Diſcourſe you ſee is alſo here forbidden; for every moment of this precious time ſhould, if poſſible, be improved to a Spiritual ufe; our own words ſhould not be ſpoken, our own pleaſure ſhould not be ſought, worldly cares &amp; fears ſhould that day be baniſhed the mind, for theſe diſtract a Man in the Service of God: <hi>Theſe are the Thorns that choak the Word, and it becometh unfruitful,</hi> Mat. 13.22. Indeed, diſtracting, carking Cares, are always unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, much more in recourſe to God himſelf; but provident Cares at other times a Duty, now become a Sin, and muſt be laid aſide as much as may be, that the Heart may be free; we read in Scripture of many ſorts of work forbidden: As Jornying upon the Lords day, but only to the Ordinance called, a Sabbath days Journey, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.29. for this diſtracts the mind as well as work: Let them look to it, that uſe that time to Ride to Fairs, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.12. Buying and Selling is alſo forbidden, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.16,17. See how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous he was againſt it; but 'tis a practice too much in Faſhion. Carrying of Burdens is alſo
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40419:88"/> forbidden, upon no leſs Cruelty than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Jer. 17.22. Nehem. 13.19. In a word, whatſoever hinders in God's Service; nay, doth not ſome way or other further it, cannot be Juſtified: As for dreſſing of Meat or Drink, any further than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or convenient; or ſpending over-much time in Bed, or needleſs Dreſſing, or ſpending time any ways unneceſſarily, is no doubt, a Sin.</p>

                     </label> Though there be a Reſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, and a Ceſſation from the works of our Calling, upon the Sabbath day; yet all works are not forbidden thereupon, there is ſtill Liberty given for good works: for works are forbidden as they tend to the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the mind, and hinder us in the Service of God; but thoſe works that further it, are not only Lawful, but Commanded; theſe in general are works of Piety, works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and works of Neceſſity: Works of Piety are ſuch as tend to the Worſhip and Service of God, as part of it, or as a means or help thereunto. Thus it was Lawful for the Prieſts under the Law to kill and Sacrifice the Beaſts that were to be Offered, which was a ſervile work, and unlawful, had it not been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Have you not read in the Law, how on the Sabbath days the Prieſts in the Temple prophane the Sabbath, and are blameleſs.</hi> And no doubt, 'tis Lawful in Goſpel Times for Miniſters to Preach the Word, Catechize, and Perſonally to Inſtruct the People, though it be
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40419:88"/> to the ſpending of their Spirits, and the Tyring of their Bodies, more than on any other day of the week: <hi>Paul</hi> he Preached long, even till mid-night, upon that day: And 'tis Lawful for him to Travel that day to the Meeting place; and 'tis Lawful for the People alſo to come to hear: Yea, 'tis their Duty, though it be ſeveral Miles, if they cannot otherwiſe enjoy it: We read of a Sabbath days Journey, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.12. which is conceived to be about two Miles. We may ſee this was a Cuſtom in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.23. when the good <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nammite</hi> deſired her Husbands leave to go to the Prophet; he anſwered her, wherefore wilt thou go to him to day, it is neither New Moon, nor Sabbath; implying theſe were uſual times to go, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.7. Every one of them in <hi>Sion</hi> appeareth before God. Works of Mercy alſo are neceſſary, whether to Man, or Beaſts; God deſires Mercy, and not Sacrifice, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. Now, this Mercy is either to the Soul, or to the Body: To the Body, viſiting the Sick, healing their Diſeaſes, eaſing their pains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their Neceſſity, if able; this is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.11. when Chriſt heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Sick, and diſputes the Caſe with the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> yea, giving, or gathering Alms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that day, which we find was the Apoſtles Command, and the Churches practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1,2. and that which Chriſt will Reward at the laſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35. Meat and Drink alſo muſt be taken moderately, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of thy Body, and the making it fit
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40419:89"/> for the Service of the day. Chriſt himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of this, when he juſtifies his Diſciples for plucking the Ears of Corn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.1,2. Spiritual Mercy muſt be ſhewed alſo; ſuch is informing the Ignorant, reducing the Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, exhorting the Negligent, comforting the Diſconſolate, Inſtructing one another in our moſt Holy Faith, Reconciling thoſe that are at variance; yea, the Bruit Beaſts themſelves muſt that day taſte of thy bounty; if one be fallen into a Ditch or Pitt, we muſt lift him out, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.5. We may, yea, muſt looſe our Ox and our Aſs from the Stall, and lead them out to water, upon that day, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.15. Phyſitians, in caſes of neceſſity, may Travel, to Viſit their ſick Patients, and Midwives at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon their Office; but it ſhould be Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Neceſſity, and not for filthy Lucre, that this ſhould be done. We ſhould not ſell our Labour upon that day, but do it for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charity; otherwiſe a juſt Cauſe may to us prove ſinful. Works of Neceſſity alſo are Lawful, ſo they be truly ſo, and not feigned: when an Houſe is on Fire, we may leave the Ordinance, to ſeek to Quench it, though with Bodily Labour. The Marriner, in his Journey, muſt attend his work, but his Heart in the mean time ſhould be in Heaven: The Souldier, if ſet upon, ſhould defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; we find <hi>Joſhua</hi> compaſſing <hi>Jericho</hi> ſeven days together, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.15. and one of them muſt needs be the Sabbath. Though the <hi>Jews</hi> at firſt did ſcruple Fighting upon that day, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40419:89"/> many of them were Murdered by the Enemy; yet at laſt they reſolved to Fight in their own Defence, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 4.1. A Husband-man, in Harveſt time, I ſuppoſe, for fear of an Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or the apparent loſs of Grain, or Hey, may Labour to prevent it; but take heed a Neceſſity be not feigned: Many are neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for want of fore-caſt, and ſome fore-caſt, that there may be a Neceſſity, neglecting it all the week, and then ſay, muſt not Cattle be looked? Or ſuch a thing be done? But know what may be done before, or let alone till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ought not to be done; 'tis not thy wilful neglect can procure a diſpenſation to break God's Law; but moſt men ſtrain their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty to the utmoſt Link, but take heed of going beyond; be not deceived, God will not be mocked.</p>

Now, the Duties required, are either Publick, or Private; the Publick are in the Congregation of the Saints, when the Church meets together to Worſhip God. The Private are in the Family, or in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet: He that only reſts from his Labour on the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40419:90"/> Sabbath, keeps it no better; yea, much worſe than a Beaſt. Idleneſs is a ſin at all times, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially then; this is the Market day to lay in Proviſion for the week following, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, to provide in, for winter, and ſhall we Trifle now? All Time is precious, much more this; we ſhould leave any work undone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould leave God's work undone, or careleſsly do it. The Publick Duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at our hands, are according to the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we ſtand in; more is required of Publick Perſons, than of Private. The Miniſters are God's Stewards to diſpence his Myſteries, to Divide the word of God aright, and to give every one his Portion; and therefore he muſt look to his Charge, and make preparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand for his work. He is the Mouth of the People unto God, and God's Mouth to them; and therefore he had need to ſet a watch over his Lips, that he Offend not with his Tongue. Parents and Maſters they ſhould not only come to the Ordinance themſelves, but bring their Children, and Servants there to be Taught. Prayer is an Ordinance of God, and ſhould be performed in the Publick, where Miniſter and People ſhould joyn together to make their Requeſts known to God in the Name of Chriſt; and beg ſuch things as are neceſſary for themſelves, or others; for this Life, or that to come: It ſhould be performed with Faith and Fervency, with Humility and Reverence, with Wiſdom and Diſcretion, both by Miniſter and People: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

They ſhould Treaſure it up in good Hearts, and bring forth good Fruit in their Lives and Converſations; for without Practice knowledge is little worth.

The Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alſo ſhould be as frequently Adminiſtred, as Convenience will permit, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. And 'tis the Miniſters Duty to Teach and Inſtruct the Ignorant, to convince the gain-ſayers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the ſcandalous, if they can; and if they will not be Reformed, to keep them back from the Sacrament; yea, to take Chriſt's

God complains of the contrary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. <hi>Her Prieſts have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated my Law, and have prophaned my Holy things, they have put no difference between the Holy and Prophane,</hi> &amp;c. And 'tis Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>not to give Holy things to Dogs,</hi> Mat. 7.8. The People they ſhould partake of it, and come with prepared Hearts to this Holy Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and be careful that they have on the Wedding Garment, or they will be no wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com Gueſts to his Marriage Supper: They ſhould there Exerciſe their Graces of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Faith, Love, and Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> knowing that the neglect, or unworthy receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a dangerous ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17.

                     </label> Though the publick Worſhip and Service of God be chiefly to be minded, and intended upon the Lord's day, yet it is not only that which is required. Many private
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40419:91"/> Duties alſo are to be performed; and in thy Publick and Private Duty is all the whole time to be ſpent. What thoſe Publick Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are I have already ſhewed you, and ſhall now ſpeak of thoſe that are Private; I mean, ſuch as Private Perſons, eſpecially Maſters, and Parents, and Governours of Families ought to do: Let the Inferiors alſo here Read their Duties. Some of thoſe are to be done before the Publick, by way of Preparation; and ſome after, by way of Digeſtion: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Preparation I have ſpoken already, and yet here ſomething may be added; for, as thou muſt remember the Sabbath before it come, to prepare for it; ſo when 'tis come, improve it to the beſt Advantage: And to this End, Riſe as timely in the Morning as thy Health will permit. Were it to go to ſome Market, or Fair, or to do ſome earneſt, or important buſineſs, how early wouldſt thou Riſe? And why not now, the better to fit thy ſelf for thy Maſters work; and to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie as much of the Conſecrated time as thou canſt, and do God as much work as may be; and Reaſon good, for God is the beſt Maſter, and pays the beſt Wages; and therefore he ſhould have moſt work done: And by this means thou wilt redeem the more time for thy private Devotion. When thou firſt awakeſt, Conſecrate thy firſt thoughts to God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the day with ſome Fruitful Meditation, ſuitable to the Seaſon, and the work in hand, for this will fit thee for after-Duties. But if
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40419:92"/> thou let the World, or Sin have thy firſt thoughts, 'tis hard getting them out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of thy Heart. Examine thine own Heart, what Graces thou haſt weak, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that thou wouldſt have ſupplyed; what Sins are ſtrong, that thou wouldſt have morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; what ſins thou haſt Committed, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the week laſt; what Mercies thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that ſo thy Heart may be affected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: Go to God with ſhame in thy Face, and ſorrow in thy Heart; and, if it may be, with Tears in thine Eyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thy ſins to him, and never reſt, till thou haſt a diſcharge. Many give themſelves ſo much Liberty of ſleeping in the Morning, that much of thoſe ſecret Duties are either neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſlubbered over, and they have little time to ſet the Heart in Order. But how can a man expect a Bleſſing, that is guilty of ſuch neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects? But theſe ſecret Duties are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. If thou haſt a Family, call them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in convenient time, Read ſome Portion of Holy Scripture to them; and, if thou canſt, faſten ſomething upon their Spirits by Familiar Diſcourſe, or otherwiſe, and then joyn with them in Prayer to God for the pardon of the ſins of the Family, and a ſupply of Grace, and a Bleſſing upon the Publick Ordinances, for their Souls good: And here forget not to put up ſome Petitions for him who is to be your mouth unto God, that he might do it prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and that he that is to be God's mouth to you, may reach your Hearts, and ſpeak a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40419:92"/> word in ſeaſon to your Souls, and meet with your beloved ſins, and put you on to your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Duties. If Holy <hi>Paul</hi> deſires the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Hearers, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.3. much more need have your Miniſters. And having thus diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thy private Devotions, make timely reſort unto the publick: 'Tis an ill Cuſtom which many have, to ſtay late, and ſavours but of little Love to the Ordinances. Theſe Men would make more haſt to a Feaſt, or Banquet, perhaps, to a Stage-Play, or Morrice-dance. And when thou haſt thus done, and brought thy Family along with thee, behave thy ſelf, and ſee that they behave themſelves gravely, and orderly, and joyn with the Miniſter; hear attentively, pray zealouſly, and ſing affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and do every Duty chearfully; write the Sermon in thy Book, or in thy Memory, eſpecially the moſt material Heads; and after the Morning Exerciſe, uſe ſobriety in Meat and Drink, leſt thy Body be ſurcharged, and become unfit for the Evening Exerciſe; for though Meat and Drink may be taken, yet no more than fits thee for thy Duty: Spend the inter-mediate-time in Prayer, Singing, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and frequent the Evening Exerciſe as thou didſt in the Morning; and when the Publick is done, ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of thy time in private Duties; as Repeating the Sermon, and Examining the proficiency of thy People, incouraging the Diligent, reproving the Idle: In Meditation of what thou haſt heard, preſſing it upon thy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40419:93"/> own, and People's Hearts, and put it into Practice, which is the Life of all; without which 'tis like Food eaten, but not digeſted; which ſeeds Diſeaſes, and not the Body. Call thy Family together, ſuffer them not to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after Vanity: Read ſome Portion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ; and, if it may be, make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand God's Will in it. Catechize, and Inſtruct them in the Fundamentals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Pray with them, and for them, for the Pardon of their ſins, and a Bleſſing upon the means; Commend them, and all thine, and all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God into God's Protection, and ſo conclude the day in Secret with God as thou beganſt; confeſs the miſcarriages of thy Heart, and bleſs God for the aſſiſtance thou haſt found; follow this courſe, and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath will prove a Market-day for thy Soul.</p>

That is, he forc'd them to an outward compliance. We find in many
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40419:94"/> places, Death is threatned to the Prophanation of this day. Now, if the Magiſtrate had not Power to puniſh, as ſome imagine, who ſhould inflict his Death? Can it be imagined, that God immediately from Heaven ſtruck them dead for every ſuch Tranſgreſſion? We find indeed, the Law Executed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.36. by the Command of God, upon the man that gathered ſticks upon the Sabbath, but it was done by the hand of man; though men cannot be compelled to become true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet they may, and ought to be forc'd to an outward Compliance, and reſtrained from the open violation of the known Laws of God, though they will not Sanctifie it in their Heart, they ſhould be reſtrained from Prophaning it with their Hands, or Tongues. Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhould not be ſuffered to deceive the People, and thoſe that Teach Errors and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, ſhould be reſtrained. But alas! here is our Miſery, we have few <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> in our Time, to redreſs theſe abuſes: Many not only do it themſelves, but take Pleaſure in thoſe that do; and the Sabbath is Prophaned, and few lay it to Heart. Miniſters alſo in their place ſhould ſee to the Obſervation of it, though they cannot compel, yet they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and denounce the Judgments of God againſt the wilful breakers of his Law: The Word and Sword ſhould go together; and if they prove obſtinate Sinners, they ſhould be caſt out, as thoſe that are not fit for a Chriſtian Society; Excommunication hath proceeded,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40419:94"/> I ſuppoſe, againſt Perſons for leſs faults in God's Account. Governors of Families alſo, whether Parents, or Maſters, ſhould look to thoſe under their Charge; for neither Son nor Daughter, Man-Servant, nor Maid-Servant, ſhould break this Law; and though they have not the Power of Life and Death, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath, yet he hath Power to Command, Rebuke, Reſtrain; and, if need be, to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect: And why hath God given this Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Hands, but to this End? <hi>Abraham, Joſhua, David,</hi> and others, did thus Reform their Families, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. <hi>throughout.

Some plead, as <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Zoar,</hi> 'tis a little one, 'tis a ſmall matter, the more ſhame to break a Command of God for a ſmall matter; if the Devil mend thy Wages, thou wilt mend thy Work, and a greater Temptation will make thee break them all, but thou wilt find none ſo ſmall; ſome plead a neceſſity for doing this

But when by the Inſtigations of Satan, man had broken this Covenant, and Tranſgreſſed that Command, which forbid him to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge, of good and Evil; he loſt by this Tranſgreſſion that Image of God, wherein he was Created, and in the room of it had the Image of Satan ſtampt upon his Soul; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Original Righteouſneſs, had Original Sin, and his whole Nature was depraved. And after which Fall, it was impoſſible that he, or any of his Poſterity, ſhould ever have been ſaved upon the firſt Covenant terms, and lay under a neceſſity of periſhing, if the great God had not found out a way, which Man nor Angel could not have done, to Reconcile ſinful Man to himſelf, by a Mediator; and to this end, ſent his own Son, out of his own Boſom, to be made Man, that being God and Man, he might be a fit Mediator between God and Man: Who by his Death and Paſſion diſcharged the Debt, bought the Priſoners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands, and enters into a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, even a Covenant of Grace; the Tenor of it is, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> and unto this Covenant the Sacrament Seals. Now, this Covenant, in the Time of the Law, and in the Time of the Goſpel, was one and the ſame for Subſtance, though under a different Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. It was then more dark, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40419:96"/> Typical; now more clear, and manifeſt: and even then alſo God gave them Seals to this Covenant, which were Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover; not that they were needful on God's part, for his Promiſes are, <hi>Yea, and Amen;</hi> but on Man's part they were, leſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of his own unworthineſs, he ſhould doubt, and deſpair of God's Mercy. Now, in the Time of the Goſpel, God alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Adminiſtration (for when the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was come, the ſhadows fled away) he altered the Seals alſo, and appointed only two, Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper: The one for our Entrance into the Church, the other for our growth and nouriſhment. Theſe, and theſe only are our Goſpel Sacraments; as for theſe five added by the Papiſts, they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly no Sacraments at all; for the Covenant of Grace is not Sealed by them. Some of them want a Divine Inſtitution, ſome of them have not the Nature of a Sacrament, and a Divine promiſe is wanting, and therefore a Bleſſing cannot be expected. Now, Baptiſm is the firſt Sacrament of the New Teſtament, both in regard of Inſtitution, Adminiſtration, Order, and Uſe, and therefore comes firſt to be Treated of. The word is taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and ſignifies to waſh, or dip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 'tis Attributed in Scripture to many things, but I ſhall not trouble you with them, only in this place we Treat of it as 'tis a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, Inſtituted by Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Perſons are dipped in, or ſprinkled with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40419:96"/> water, in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; and ſo Dedicated, and Devoted to the Service, and Worſhip of God; and entred into his Church, and Liſted into his Company, his School, and Family, and have all the Bleſſings, and Benefits of the New Covenant; Chriſt, and all his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Merits, and Graces, Pardon of Sin, Regeneration, Adoption, Sanctification, and Glorification Sealed up to them; for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it is of a cleanſing Nature, ſignifies the Blood of Chriſt, which cleanſeth us from all Sin. In this Sacrament there is a mutual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made, and ratified between Chriſt and the Soul; the Soul gives up it ſelf to Chriſt, promiſing Obedience to his known Will, and that he will Worſhip no other god, but Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: And God, for his part, promiſes Chriſt, and his Benefits, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that Man prove Faithful in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and no doubt, God will not fail in his part, if Man perform, which that thou mayſt do, take theſe Directions.</p>

The very Eſſence of Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is denyed by ſome, and queſtioned by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whether it be a ſtanding Ordinance in the Church; but that which ſome queſtion, and others deny, I think need not be queſtioned, and cannot be denyed; and for their Confutation,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40419:97"/> I need ſay no more, but ſearch the Scriptures; for he that reads the Scripture, and believes what he reads, cannot be Ignorant. Baptiſm was given in Commiſſion by Chriſt to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19,20. and that it was to be done with Water, ſee it in their Practice; you find <hi>Philip</hi> Baptizing the <hi>Eunuch</hi> with Water, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. And <hi>Peter</hi> Baptized <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> thus, and his Family; in both places Water is mentioned, and they were both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Directed to do it by the Holy Ghoſt. But the greateſt Controverſie lies elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, between us and the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who it be, that are Subjects capable of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, this therefore ſhall fall next under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. I need not ſtep ſo far out of my way, as to tell you they ought to be rational Creatures, ſuch as are capable of being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to have the Graces and Benefits of the Covenant beſtowed upon them, and ſo ſtand to reprove the fooliſh, ridiculous Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in Baptizing Bells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither need I tell you it muſt be a Living Creature, and not one that is dead; and ſo reprove the Cuſtom of thoſe, which ſeemed to be Baptized for the dead, or in their ſtead, or in their Name; a Cuſtom which ſeemed to be crept into the Church, in the Apoſtles days, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Cuſtom <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeak of. But to come nearer the Queſtion in Controverſie; you may aſſure your ſelves, that thoſe, and thoſe only that are Members of the viſible Church, are to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40419:97"/> partake of this Ordinance: Thoſe that are in Covenant ſhould partake of the Sign and Seal of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Now, theſe are the Godly, and their Seed, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.39. <hi>The Promiſe is unto you and to your Children.</hi> The ſeed of Faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> are either thoſe that are of Riper Years, or of Infants: Thoſe that are of Riper Years, are ſuch, as being Converted to the Faith, hold faſt the Foundation, and manifeſt Repentance, for ſins paſt, and profeſs Obedience for the time to come; and of thoſe, I think, is no ſcruple made by any that own the Ordinance, if there be, ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15,16. <hi>Acts</hi> 37.38. Now, Infants that are within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are ſuch as have one, or both Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parents; that is, ſuch as profeſs Faith in Chriſt, and Obedience to him, and Live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, that the Children of thoſe are in the Covenant, and have right to the Seal, by a Birth-priviledge, many able Divines have largely proved, both by Scriptures and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Scriptures they make uſe of, are ſuch as theſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11,12. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38,39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11,12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15,16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. and many others. Now, you muſt know, that Godly Parents are under a two-fold Conſideration, as they are Men, and the ſinful Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo their Children are the Children of wrath by Nature; but as they are Believers, and the Sons of Faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ingraffed into

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40419:98"/> Viſible Church upon their Parents Account: It is their Birth-priviledge, and therefore 'tis requiſite that they receive the ſign, and ſeal of the Covenant, which is Baptiſm; that being the initiating ſign whereby Members are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly entred into the Church, Souldiers are Liſted into Chriſt's Company, and Scholars into his School; and therefore 'tis the Parents Duty to preſent them, and to Enter them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Covenant, and bring them timely unto this Ordinance, and Dedicate them unto the Lord, even in their Infancy, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did <hi>Samuel,</hi> even when he was a Child. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Child claims this not as he is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, but as he is the Child of ſuch Parents: 'Tis neceſſary that the Parents, one, or both, be rightly qualified; they ſhould be ſuch as own God in ſincerity: For though a ſerious Profeſſion, not contradicted by a vicious life, may, and muſt ſatisfie the Church, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſearch the Heart, yet it will not ſatifie God, who tryeth the Reins and the Heart. 'Tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary alſo that they have a competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Knowledge, as well as Faith, and the other Graces of the Spirit, that ſo they may perform the Duties required. 'Tis requiſite they ſhould know in what condition their Children are in by Nature; that they are born the Children of Wrath, as well as others, and derived a poyſonful Nature, even from them; for though they themſelves may be Gracious, yet they begat not their Children as they were Gracious, but as Men and Women, the ſinful
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40419:99"/> Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam;</hi> 'tis Nature and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not Grace, that is derivative. A Man will never prize a Plaiſter, that knows of no Wound; nor Phyſick, that knows not that he is Sick; nor this Remedy, till he know of the Diſeaſe. The knowledge of this will make a man admire God's Goodneſs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Children, and to bewail the inward Diſtempers of the Soul; and wraſtle with God for the Pardon of this Corruption, and for his Sanctifying Grace, and Spirit, when others little regard it; and bleſs God, that hath provided ſuch a Remedy, ſent ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour into the World, and entred into ſuch a Covenant; not only with Believers, but their Seed; and given ſuch a Seal to it, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Faith: For though it aboliſh not Sin utterly, as ſome Teach, yet hath it a tendency to the Mortification, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. They ſhould know alſo, by what Right their Infants enjoy this Priviledge; this ſhould put them upon it, to clear up their own Intereſt, and improve it, to renew their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to Act Faith, and ſuck ſweetneſs from the Promiſes, which are made to Believers, and their Children; and upon this Confidence that God is their God, and the God of their Seed; they ſhould Offer up their Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and Dedicate, and Devote them to his Service, as I ſaid before; Liſt them into his Army, and Enter them into his School, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him not only to allow them the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal badge of Church-Members, but alſo make
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40419:99"/> them Members of the Inviſible Church; yea, Living Members of Chriſt's Myſtical Body: And be earneſt with God to Baptize them, not only with Water, but alſo with the Holy Ghoſt; and lay claim to the Ordinances upon this Account; and not only ſo, but 'tis their Duty to endeavour what in them lyes, to make them his Servants, by Training them up in his Fear, and to Teach them their Duty, both to God and Man. For, as Parents uſually Covenant for their Children about the Affairs of the World, and Intereſt them in Earthly Priviledges; ſo do they here Enter them into the Covenant, and Intereſt them thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bleſſings of the Covenant, except af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they wilfully revoke it. Parents neglect of this was formerly accounted a great Sin; as we ſee in <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4.24. when God would have killed him for neglecting Circumciſion, and threatens ſuch a Soul that is not thus Dedicated, to be cut off from his People, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. And where God chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his mind, or relaxed this Law, is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily found. But alas! how careleſs are moſt Parents of this Duty?

                     </label> In this Duty aim at God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the ſtrengthening of thy Faith, and the good of thy own, and thy Childrens Souls: Many a good Action is ſpoyled for want of a good End, as I told you, the Faſting, Prayers, and Alms of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this Ordinance God aims at the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Ends; his Glory is his ultimate End, and ſhould be ours: He annexes this Seal to his Covenant to ſtrengthen our Faith; uſe it therefore to this End. And by this our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Entered into Covenant: As we Live, and Move, and have our Being from him, ſo we ſhould Live, and Move, and Act for him; not only in this, but in all other Duties: This is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, and in this it excels all the Water in the World: For our Baptiſmal water, though not in regard of it's Eſſence, yet in it's Uſe and Efficacy, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all other, though never ſo precious: others may Comfort the Heart, but cannot Sanctifie it; <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Pharpar,</hi> Rivers of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> may be more beautiful to the Eye, than the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> yet cannot heal <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie; it had not that Sanctive virtue put into it by God. So this Baptiſmal water is ſet apart, and Sanctified to an Holy Uſe; even to Seal the Covenant of Grace to Believers, in which Covenant God offers Chriſt, to be our Lord, and Saviour; and promiſes with him to give us pardon of Sin, Regeneration, Adoption, Sanctification, and Redemption; yea, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Glory; and thereupon ſets to his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40419:100"/> Seal in this Sacrament: And Man, on his part, promiſeth to take Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel, to be his Lord and Saviour; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to believe in him, to be Ruled by him, to forſake all other for him, and to be his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant to his Death; and thereupon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Offered Element, and ſo puts to his Seal to the Covenant, and by ſo doing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes himſelf to his Service. So that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is an engaging Sign, and Seal of the Covenant between God and Man: All the Bleſſings of the New Covenant are included here; for the Seal is of as large an extent as the Covenant it ſelf, and as a Seal accepted to an Evidence, makes it Authentick; much more God's Seal annexed to his Word, is firm and ſure; Heaven and Earth may paſs away, but God's Word, thus Ratified, ſhall never fail. We have God's Promiſe, under Hand and Seal, and if we perform on our part, doubtleſs, God will never fail on his; he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us hereby, that he will be a Reconciled Father to us in Chriſt; and we ſhall be his Adopted Sons and Daughters, he will be our God, which is more than can be expreſſed in words, or conceived in mind. Now, from this Covenant thus ratified, a Believer in the ſaddeſt Affliction may fetch Comfort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing. The Spirit it ſelf being the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this Seal, produceth it many times to a Chriſtians Comfort; and enables him to read his Name in the Covenant, and ſhews him the Great Seal for it. Thus <hi>David</hi> could fetch
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40419:101"/> Comfort from his Circumciſion, when he was to Encounter with <hi>Goliath; what is this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Philiſtine,</hi> &amp;c. And why may not we from our Baptiſm, in our Conflicts with the <hi>Goliath</hi> of Hell? God is not a Man, that he ſhould lye, nor the Son of Man, that he ſhould Repent. Now, that this is a Seal of the Covenant, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. where Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is Called the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, in which place Baptiſm ſucceeds. See alſo, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11,12. wherein we ſee, <hi>We are Buried with him in Baptiſm, and with him alſo raiſed again.</hi> And that all the Bleſſings of the New Covenant are Sealed by this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>For as many of you as have been Baptized into Chriſt have put on Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6.4,5. where the Benefits both of his Death and Reſurrection are promiſed; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Remiſſion of Sins, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. Yea, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4. By this Ordinance we give up our ſelves unto Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.34.

Doſt thou Enter him into the Covenant, with an intent to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him to the Lord, and Train him up in his fear; to bring him into God's Family, and make him a Member of his Myſtical Body? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

So 'tis here, Baptiſm differenceth Chriſtians from others; but 'tis the Baptiſm
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40419:102"/> of the Spirit that differenceth the good from the bad. Yet theſe External Priviledges ought not to be ſleighted, as the Apoſtle Argues at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1,2, &amp;c. yet ought they not to be truſted to, or reſted in. The main thing intended in this Ordinance, is, that Chriſt, and all his benefits be Sealed up unto the Soul, therefore lay hold by Faith upon theſe things, or thy Labour will be loſt: This Sacrament is the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.

But if thou take up any thing under Chriſt, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance will be of little worth to thee. When thou bringeſt thy Child therefore to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, take not up with Common Benefits; lay out for Chriſt, and ſatisfie not thy ſelf without him. The Ordinance of it ſelf is but a dry, and empty Husk, Chriſt is the Kirnel; 'tis as a Well, Chriſt is the Water; and what good will a dry Well do thee? 'Tis but a broken Ciſtern, if truſted to, it can hold no Water: What is a little cold Water applyed to the Body, if the Water of Life be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Soul?

Perſwade thy ſelf therefore, that ſeeing ſuch Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions hold forth the Sacrament to be the Laver of Regeneration, and the New Birth, to waſh from ſin, and is Inſtrumental to our Salvation, and Sealeth up the Covenant, yea, Chriſt, and all his Benefits to the Soul. No doubt it will be ſo to thee, and to thy Children, if the failing be not on your part. When thou ſeeſt the Miniſter apply the Baptiſmal water to the Body of thy Infant, do thou by Faith behold God the Father applying Chriſt, his Merits,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40419:103"/> his Blood and Benefits to the Soul; and as verily as thou ſeeſt the one done Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo verily do thou believe the other to be done really, and truly. 'Tis the coming to the Sacrament without Faith, and without the word of Promiſe, that makes it ſeem ſo empty, and vain; but doubtleſs, there is a rich ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be had. If we ſuck, we ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: the Well indeed is deep, and Faith is the Bucket: If we have no Bucket, we are like to have no Water.</p>

                     </label> That this Sacrament of Baptiſm be rightly Adminiſtred, it is neceſſary that it be done agreeably, to the mind, and will of God, expreſſed in his Word; for God will have his own work done in his own way; he hath not left it to Man to uſe his own will in his Worſhip: But we muſt follow the Pattern, and Example he hath left us, and Obey the Precept and Command he hath given us; and be directed by Scripture Light, and perform the Duty in a right manner, and form, as well as to a right End. 'Tis neceſſary therefore in the firſt place, that it be Adminiſtred by a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter; 'tis the work of thoſe that are in Commiſſion, and we find not any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Sealed unto any other than the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, the Miniſters of Chriſt, ſet apart by God, and the Church for this, and other Holy Duties, for the work of the Miniſtry; that this is part of their Commiſſion, we may read <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19,20. <hi>Go Teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40419:103"/> the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I Commanded you; and loe I am with you always, even to the End of the World.</hi> Thoſe therefore that run before they are ſent, and incroach upon this holy Ordinance, without a Call, let them remember the ſin of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and alſo their Puniſhment, for incroaching upon the Prieſts Office. And as he muſt be rightly Called, ſo he ſhould be rightly Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the work; that he may not only know, but alſo Teach the People the Nature, End, Uſe, and Benefit of this Sacrament; that he bring not forth a dumb Idol, which neither he, nor the People know, nor Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. The Subject Recipient ought alſo to be rightly Qualified, if he be of Years of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion, he ſhould know the Principles of Religion; the Nature, End, and Uſe of the Sacrament: He ſhould profeſs Faith in, and ſubmiſſion to Chriſt. And if they are Infants, the Parents ſhould be thus Qualified. The Church they have their Duties too; 'Tis their Duty, not only to be Spectators, but to joyn Hand and Heart in the Work, that they beg of God for the Party Baptized; that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sign, and Seal, but the Grace of the Covenant may be conferred, and that a Seed may be ſown in this Ordinance, that in time may ſpring forth. 'Tis neceſſary alſo that a right Element be uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> water, true, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural water, without any Sophiſtication, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Compoſition, for this is agreeable to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40419:104"/> the will of Chriſt; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Addition of Salt, Spittle, and Cream, is a Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and no wiſe pleaſing to God. We find Chriſt was Baptized with water, and the Apoſtles uſed no other: The River <hi>Jordan, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and other places were frequented to this End. Thus the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> were Baptized; and this is moſt ſuitable to the End for which it was Ordained, and beſt Anſwers the Type and Shadow of it, in the time of the Law, and ſerves beſt to ſignifie, and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the blood of Chriſt; for as water is of a mundifying Nature, ſo is the Blood of Chriſt unto the Soul; and this alſo is agreeable unto Antiquity, water being always uſed in the Primitive Time. <hi>Niciphorus</hi> Reports, when a Miniſter, for want of Water, uſed <hi>Sand</hi> in Baptizing a Man; that Baptiſm was by the Church accounted a Nullity, and the Man was after Baptized with water. And it muſt alſo be done in a Lawful, and due manner &amp; Form; the External Form conſiſts in the Miniſters words and Actions: For words, 'tis not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to uſe what words he pleaſeth, but the words of Inſtitution; he muſt Baptize in the Name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: And his Actions ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Words, and ſo he muſt either dip, or dive, the Baptized Party into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or pour, or ſprinkle water upon him. 'Tis conceived in the Primitive Time, in thoſe Hot Countreys, dipping in the water was moſt uſed, which in ſome places, eſpecially
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40419:104"/> in thoſe cold Countreys, the Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for God will have Mercy, and not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and the Scripture ſeems to hold forth many favourable Inſtances, for waſhing or ſprinkling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.19.20,21. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. &amp; 16.33. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. It is not like that all theſe were dipped; the word in the Original ſignifies waſhing, whether by Diving into the water, or by pouring water upon, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. For as Circumciſion, applyed to one part of the Body, did ſuffice; ſo Baptiſm, though the water be not applyed to the whole, may yet ſignifie the blood of Chriſt applyed to the Soul; and the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſaid to be ſprinkled with this Blood; for as a little Bread, and a little Wine ſignifies whole Chriſt; ſo a little water ſignifies his Blood; and ſerve to ſeal the Covenant as well as more.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40419:105"/> pay that which thou haſt vowed: Better it is that thou ſhouldeſt not Vow, than to Vow, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi> Thou haſt in thy Baptiſm Dedicated thy ſelf up to God, and bound over thy ſelf to his Obedience; thou haſt taken Preſs-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from him, and engaged thy ſelf to fight his Battles, and to be an Enemy to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: And canſt thou without horrid Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery fight the Devils Battles againſt him? Thou haſt vowed thy ſelf againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil; and wilt thou take part with them againſt God? It is Death for a Souldier to leave his Colours, and ſide with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and is it nothing to leave God, when we have taken Preſs-money, and Pay from him, and joyn with the Devil againſt him?

The keeping whereof would make them everlaſtingly Happy; and the breach thereof will make them eternally Miſerable. What horrid Treachery is it for thee to vow Service unto God, and to perform it to the Devil, and the World? To carry God's Mark in thy Fore-head, and the Devils Brand in thy Heart. To call thy ſelf a Chriſtian, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40419:105"/> Live the Life of an Heathen, or Infidel? What is this, but to put a Sheeps skin upon a Wolves back? Or the Kings ſtamp upon counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Coin? Conſider if thou do thus, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm will be ſo far from ſaving thee, that it will condemn thee; and the Baptiſmal water that was caſt upon thee will prove, like the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Jealouſie,</hi> unto the defiled Woman, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.27. it will be attended with a viſible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and prove a Curſe, and not a Bleſſing: What benefit doſt thou intend to receive by it? Doſt expect the Benefit of the Covenant? Doſt imagine that God is engaged to thee, and not thee to him? Thou art much deceived, if thou break with him, thou diſ-ingageſt him. God indeed Offers Chriſt, if thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; and promiſes upon that Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a reconciled Father to thee, to give thee Remiſſion of ſin, Regeneration, Adoption, and Glory for ever; and hereunto he puts this Seal to the Covenant: And thou promiſeſt upon thy part to accept of Chriſt upon the offered terms, vowedſt Obedience to him, and Dedicateſt thy ſelf to his Service, and thereupon accepteſt the offered Sacrament, and ſetteſt thy Seal to the Covenant. Now, if thou perform thy part, God will, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perform his: Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away before one tittle of his Word ſhall paſs, eſpecially that given, and ratified under his Hand and Seal; but if thou break with him, and accept not of thoſe Mercies upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Conditions, God is not engaged to

No, no, God will caſhire, and disband ſuch Souldiers, and caſt out ſuch Non-proficients out of his School, and ſuch unfaithful Servants out of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But alas! how many of theſe may we find in the World?

And breaſts of Conſolation, where thou mayſt ſuck, and be ſatisfied.

Uſe it therefore for the beſt Advantage for thy Soul: This is a needful, though much neglected Duty. The ſerious Conſideration of the End and Uſe of Baptiſm, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and priviledges Sealed up by it to us, and ours, and our own ingagements therein to God, may be of great Uſe to us in the whole courſe of our Lives, in many caſes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Baptiſm may be compared to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage knot, by virtue whereof the Wife lays claim, not only to her Husband, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is her Husbands; and 'tis as a Seal to an Evidence, which ratifies it, and makes it Authentick, and adds force and Efficacy to it. Baptiſm, though not to be iterated, or renewed, yet the Covenant thereby once Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, remains Authentick for ever, till we pluck off the Seal, or renounce the Covenant. This is a notable means to put us on to mourn for our Sins, and therefore 'tis called the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Repentance; as it doth oblige us to Repent, for the conſideration of our Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages towards God, ſince we gave up our ſelves to him, and the falling ſhort of what we have promiſed, and might have been, and done may well keep us humble, and penitent. When we are tempted to ſin, and to break the Commands of God by ſin, we may look back to our Covenants to the contrary, and the Vows which we have made; and it may ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrifie
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40419:107"/> us to think that we ſhould break ſuch a Covenant with God, when we make ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Promiſe to Man. Think with thy ſelf, have I dedicated my ſelf to God? What Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is it? What perfidious Treachery is it now to Serve the Devil, his ſworn Enemy? Haſt thou Vowed Obedience to thy Maker, and promiſed to renounce the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh; how then canſt thou think to look God in the Face at the laſt day, if now thou ſideſt with his greateſt Enemies? Was thy Body waſhed with water, ſignifying the blood of Chriſt, and ſhall thy Soul be ſtill defiled? Wilt thou return, with the Dog, to the Vomit, and the waſhed Sow, to her wallowing in the Mire? How may the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this fill thee with ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? Hence alſo thou mayſt ſet Faith on work to fetch virtue from the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, to kill ſin in thee, and raiſe thee up to newneſs of Life; for if thou be Buried with him in Baptiſm, 'tis thy Duty thus to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3,4,5. When Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtrong, fetch ſtrength hence to weaken it; when Grace is weak, hence thou mayſt ſtrengthen it. This is an excellent means to aſſure thee of thy Salvation, of the Pardon of thy ſins, and the reſt of the Mercies promiſed in the Covenant; for the Covenant being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and Sealed, what ſhould hinder the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance?

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40419:107"/> or ſet his Seal to a blank: No, no; nor if thou revoke not, he will not revoke. Is not this the Sacrament of Regeneration?

                  <p>THE next Duty to be ſpoken to, is the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which is an Ordinance of God, wherein by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſigns of Bread and Wine, ſet apart, and Sanctified to that End and Uſe, and duly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by God's appointment, the Lord ſignifieth, and Sealeth up the Truth of his Covenant to his Elect; and they Seal up their Covenant with him. This Sacrament is a Sign to Repreſent, a Seal to Confirm, and an Inſtrument to convey Chriſt, and all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to a Believing Soul. The principal Efficient Cauſe, or Author of this Sacrament, is the whole Trinity, but eſpecially Chriſt, who is the Angel of the Covenant; he it is that made the Covenant, and ratified it with his Blood; and therefore it muſt be he that adds the Seals, he makes the Promiſes, and muſt make them good. The Eſſential parts, or Matter of the Sacrament, are either Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or Internal, the one perceived by our Bodily Eyes, the other by the Eye of Faith: The External is the outward Signs, or Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, <hi>viz.</hi> Bread and Wine; which, though they are not changed into the Body and Blood
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40419:108"/> of Chriſt, as the Papiſts Teach; yet are they not naked, bare, or empty things; but ſuch as really exhibit, yea, Seal Chriſt, and all his Benefits to a Believing Soul: No other Bread nor Wine in the World, though a drop, a bit were worth a Kingdom, are to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereunto. The Internal Matter is Chriſt, and all his Graces; theſe are ſignified, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, exhibited, and applyed by the outward Elements. The Form is that which gives a Being, and perfection to the Matter, without the which this Bread and Wine would be but Common Bread and Wine: This alſo is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or Internal; the External Form conſiſts in the Lawful Adminiſtration, and participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, according to God's Word; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Form is the Union between the Sign and the thing ſignified. Now, this Sacramental Union is an Act of God's Spirit, by whoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue Chriſt his Merits, and Benefits are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembled, and preſented to the mind, but are really made one, with the Elements; yet this Union is not Natural, according to place, for there is no mutation of the Sign into the thing ſignified; neither is the thing ſignified included, or faſtened to the thing ſignifying, it cannot be a local Union, that Chriſt's Body ſhould be locally preſent with the Sign; for Chriſt's Body, though Glorified, cannot be in all places at once. Neither is it a Phyſical Union, as if of two United, loſing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Forms, ſhould by a mixture make a third; but 'tis a Spiritual Union, whereby the Lord
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40419:109"/> Jeſus is really conveyed to the Soul; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Divine preſence, and the preſence of his Spirit, he is preſent with his Body and Blood, not locally, but Sacramentally; he is Symbolically preſent to the mind, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Spiritually by the Eye of Faith; Efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preſent, though abſent in Place; yet we find the fruit of his preſence in our Spirits, the Ends of the Sacrament are the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Faith, the Sealing of the Covenant of Grace, and to be a Badge or Note of our Profeſſion, to be a pledge of our Obedience to, and Communion with Chriſt, and a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our Society with the Church; and may ſeem as a Proſpective Glaſs to view Chriſt afar off. In the Covenant, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to be our God, and the God of our Seed, and ſets to his Seal; and we Seal the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane, and ingage that we and ours will Serve the Lord; and by virtue of this Covenant; ſo mutually entred into, all the Promiſes and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Covenant are ours: ſo that you ſee a right receiving of this Sacrament is of very great Concernment, and the unworthy Receiving is very dangerous. Here is <hi>Manna</hi> for a believing Soul, but Poyſon to an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiver: This nouriſhed <hi>Peter,</hi> but Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned <hi>Judas;</hi> it feeds the good, but kills the bad; it makes ſome better, and ſome worſe; ſome more Holy, and ſome more Prophane; it increaſeth Grace where Grace is, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth Guilt where Grace is wanting: 'Tis like the Sun when it ſhines upon a Garden
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40419:109"/> of Herbs, it makes them ſmell more odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferouſly, when upon a Dung-Hill it makes it ſmell more fulſomly: 'Tis like the paſſing through the Red Sea, ſafe to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> dangerous to the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> he that brings ſtrange Fire he ſhall be burnt by it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. God will be Honoured by thoſe that draw near to him; he that comes without a Wedding Garment, ſhall go away, not with Grace in his Heart, but with Bolts upon his Heels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. According to a mans preparation, ſuch is like to be his Entertainment: He that Sows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſhall Reap nothing; and he that Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Vanity, ſhall Reap Folly; and he that Sows ſparingly, ſhall Reap little, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. He that taketh moſt care and pains is like to have the beſt Crop. Me-thinks there needs no more Motives to perſwade you, than the benefit of worthy Receiving, and the danger of the contrary; the one hath his Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the other his ſin; the one hath his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation Sealed up; the other, without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, his Damnation: He hath God's Curſe under Seal, and they Eat and Drink their own Damnation, and are guilty of Chriſt's Death.</p>

Without Grace in Exerciſe this Ordinance will do thee little good: Thou mayſt indeed eat the Bread, and drink the Wine, theſe are bodily Actions, but without Faith thou canſt not feed upon Chriſt in the Ordinance; and what good will a bit of Bread, or a ſup of Wine do thee? Faith is the Hand that receives him, the Mouth that feeds upon him, and the Stomach that digeſts him, and ſucks ſweetneſs from him. Try whether thou haſt Spiritual Life; a Man, by Nature, is dead in ſins and Treſpaſſes, and without Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he remains thus; and what good will a Feaſt do to a Dead Man? If you put Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Dead Man's mouth, what is he benefited by it? Will it nouriſh him? Can he eat it, ſwallow, or Digeſt it, when he cannot Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any Act of Life, without which, Food will be in vain? No more can this Sacrament nouriſh till a Man be Regenerated, and new born, and have a Principle of Spiritual Life put into him. A wicked Man is a Stranger to the Covenant of Grace; he hath not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Qualifications, neither doth he intend to keep the Condition; and what then hath he to do with the Seal? Or what hope can he have of the Priviledges?

A wicked Man is Uncircumciſed in Heart, and

Now, theſe Habitual Qualifications are ſuch as the Scripture requires, and ſuch as make up the Wedding Garment: And a Man ſhould have Evidences to ſhew, before he lay claim to ſuch an Ordinance; he ſhould be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, before he receive the Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. This Ordinance is not for the begetting, but for the ſtrengthening of Grace. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to this End, bids a Man <hi>Examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.28,29. <hi>For he that eateth this Bread, and drinketh this Cup of the Lord unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body.</hi> The word Examine ſignifies to take a ſtrict Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf, and make a diligent ſearch into himſelf; as whether he be Gold, or droſs; whether he be chaff, or Wheat; it may be it is a Metaphor taken from a Goldſmith, that try their Gold, whether it be pure, and the droſs purged out, and conſumed; or from thoſe that try their Coin, not ſuperficially, but by the weight, by the ſight, by the ſound, by the touch ſtone, that ſo they may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with what is bad, and counterfeit; and ſo muſt we in this caſe: Eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Devil hath much counterfeit coin goes abroad for currant, and moſt Men are deceived; and 'tis eaſie to be deceived, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when our own Hearts are the greateſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40419:111"/> Cheats, Try thy Evidences for Heaven, whether thou art Regenerated or not; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou art not for Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 3.3.5. Whether thou art an Adopted Child of God? For none elſe ought to eat at his Table: Chriſt will not be Food to nouriſh any other, he will not have the Devils Brats Dine at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; none ought to ſit there but thoſe that ſhall ſit with him in the Kingdom of Heaven: Haſt thou thoſe Graces that always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny converſion? For theſe are neceſſary in this work, as Sanctified, and Sanctifying know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without which thou canſt not diſcern the Lord's Body, or know God, or thy ſelf, or the Tenure of the Covenant of Grace, the Nature of the Sacrament, or the ſtate of thy own Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith alſo is neceſſary to lay hold upon Chriſt in this Ordinance, and feed upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Repentance for ſin paſt, and new Obedience for the time to come. Love alſo to God, to his Word, and to his Children, with a longing deſire after Chriſt in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for what ſhall we do at a Feaſt without a ſtomack: The Trial of theſe Graces I ſhall now wave, having in another Treatiſe partly handled it; 'tis called, <hi>The Souls Looking-Glaſs, or, a Spiritual Touch-ſtone,</hi> to which I refer you, becauſe I will not <hi>Actum agere,</hi> do a thing that is done before.</p>

I ſay, though this be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet it is not ſufficient; 'tis not enough to have a Marriage Garment, but we muſt have it on, and made clean and handſom, if we would Honour the Wedding. 'Tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have Faith, and Knowledge, and Love, and Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Habit; but we muſt have them in the Exerciſe: what good will they do us, if we uſe them not? 'Tis not enough to have Lamps in our Hands, yea, and Oyl in our Veſſels, though moſt go without, but we muſt have our Lamps always burning; we muſt riſe, and trim our Lamps. When we go to meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Bride-groom Chriſt in ſuch a Duty, we muſt ſnuff our Candles, that they may burn bright: 'Tis not enough for a Muſician to have an Inſtrument, but he muſt have it in Tune, or it will yield bad Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; nay, he muſt have skill to uſe it, or it will not do; nay, he muſt be in a capacity to make uſe of his skill, which is not if his hands be cold or numb'd, or otherwiſe out of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Souls Muſick is quickly ſpoyled if it be out of Tune: 'Tis not enough for a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, or Joyner to have Tools, and Matter to work upon, but he muſt often by grinding, or whetting, put an edge upon them, or they are not fit for his purpoſe. 'Tis not enough
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40419:112"/> to have Houſhold ſtuff in abundance, but it muſt be ſet in Order, not on a confuſed heap; yea, and ſcoured, and made bright, if we would uſe them to adorn the Houſe. And in like manner, 'tis not enough for a Chriſtian to have the fore-mentioned Habits, and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, but he muſt reduce them into Art and Exerciſe; he muſt ſcour them up againſt ſuch a good Time as this, and rub off the ruſt, and make them fit for uſe; yea, make uſe of them, for to this End they were given. And a Chriſtian, notwitſtanding the Habits, may, and will be an unworthy Receiver, if they be not in Exerciſe. 'Tis neceſſary that ſome Vital Operations co-operate to the Receiving, Digeſting, and Concocting our Meat, or it will not nouriſh; and ſo that this Spiritual Food may prove Refreſhing to the Soul: 'Tis neceſſary that there be a principle of Spiritual Life, and the Actings of Grace, concur with the Receiving, and Digeſting of it. A God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man may ſometimes be in an Appoplexy, and have a ſtupifyed Soul, and a benumbed Conſcience; he may have his ſwooning Fits, when Life is ſcarce diſcerned to appear: It may ſeem <hi>David</hi> ſometimes was in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or ſome other great Diſtemper. Now, you know though there be Life, yet in ſuch caſe 'tis not ſafe to give Food; ſtir up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Graces, and get them in Exerciſe, 'tis the beſt way to procure heat and digeſtion: Conſider ſeriouſly what thou art about, and with whom thou haſt to do, and what is the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40419:112"/> danger of unworty Receiving, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the contrary: Conſider thou haſt a price put into thy Hand, O let not an Heart be wanting to get wiſdom. In this Ordinance all thy wants may be ſupplyed; here thy Graces may be ſtrengthened, and thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God renewed. Thy Covenant with God is here ratified, and Chriſt, and all his Benefits made over to thy Soul: Here thou mayſt have the pardon of thy ſins, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe is requiſite for thy Soul, if thou come preparedly, and Act Faith upon the Promiſe, and improve thy Intereſt in the Covenant; come therefore with a Thirſting deſire of Chriſt in the Ordinances; this is a Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.12. <hi>John</hi> 7.37. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40419:113"/> though laſt in the Execution, is firſt in the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 'tis the firſt mover: What is it that a man will do, but is for ſome End; this, like the weights on a Clock, or the Spring in a Watch, ſets all the Wheels on work, and is the cauſe of the Entrance, and continuance of the Motion: Who is it that Builds an Houſe, but he propounds ſome End for ſo doing, otherwiſe 'tis an irrational Enterpriſe? The skilful Archer ſhoots not at random, but the Mark is in his Eye. The skilful Pilot propounds to himſelf the wiſhed Haven, as his End, and all his endeavour tends thither. Every one incoming to the Ordinance propounds one End or other, but if thou propound a wrong End, take what pains thou wilt, thou wilt, like the <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 6.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> loſe thy Reward, if thou perform, with them, a Commanded Duty, and aim not at God's Glory, but thy own, thou muſt look a Reward elſewhere, and not from God. The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as they Corrupt this Sacrament, in leaving the Inſtitution, and making Additions, and detractions of their own deviſing, which never came into the mind of God; ſo they pervert it to wrong Ends to further their own Helliſh deſigns; as to Murder Kings, blow up Parliaments, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacree Proteſtants, and conceal their Helliſh Plots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many others, I fear, come with baſe, low, and unworthy Ends to this Sacrament. Cuſtom brings ſome, ſhame others, fear of the Law a third ſort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40419:113"/> coming in their ſin, with unprepared Hearts, and vicious Lives: They make the Table of the Lord the Table of Devils, as the Apoſtle complains; and inſtead of Sealing the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, they Seal a Covenant with the Devil, to remain his Slaves, and have the Curſe of God, and their own Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under Seal. Now, the Principal End which Chriſtians ſhould aim at, is God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the Remembrance of the Death of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24.26. <hi>Do this,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>in Remembrance of me:</hi> By eating this Bread, and drinking this Cup, we ſhew the Lord's Death till he comes. Theſe Elements ſet apart, and Sanctified to this Holy Uſe, being thus taken, we profeſs, and, in a manner, Preach to others the Death of Chriſt, and the Benefits thereby procured, which is the ſum of the Goſpel. This Sacrament is unto Chriſtians as the Pillar of Stone Erected in the midſt of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> for a Memorial of the wonderful paſſing of <hi>Iſrael</hi> over <hi>Jordan;</hi> or, as the Pot of <hi>Manna,</hi> commanded to be kept in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was forty Years fed in the Wilderneſs with Bread from Heaven. So is this Sacrament to be Received, even to the End of the World, in a Memorial of Chriſt's Death, and Bloody Paſſion, and the Benefits procured to the Church by it. And if <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſufficient Cauſe to keep the Paſſeover for a Memorial of their Deliverance from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage; much more, and greater cauſe have Chriſtians to keep this Feaſt, for a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40419:114"/> Memorial of their Deliverance from this Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Devil, and his Slavery: This is one End why God left us Sacraments, that whenever we did partake of them, we might Remember this Deliverance, and bleſs God for it; this ſhould put us in mind what Chriſt hath done for us: His Life, his Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, his Miracles, his Death and Paſſion, and the whole work of our Redemption. But alas! many Men, when they have the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Mouths, have the Devil in their Hearts; they ſeldom mention God's Name, except in an Oath, or vain ſpeech: But theſe Mens damnation ſleepeth not. Another End is the Sealing of the Covenant between God and us, as I have often mentioned; God on his part ratifies it, and aſſures us by his Seal, he will make it good. And we on our part Dedicate our ſelves to his Service, and annex our Seal: He promiſes to be our God, and we promiſe to be his People: But many are not in the Covenant, and have nothing to do with the Seal, for this is not a begetting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance but confirming thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: ſuch as theſe Seal a Covenant with Death, and Hell, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15. This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is like the Water of Jealouſie, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law, if a Woman that drinks of it were pure, it would make her fruitful; if defiled, it would make her Thigh to rot, and her Belly to ſwell. Another End is for the increaſing Faith, and other Graces; 'tis not for the begetting, but increaſing Grace, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40419:114"/> therefore pre-ſuppoſeth Grace to be there; as alſo for the maintaining Communion with God, and Love one with another, they being Members of the ſame Body, and Heirs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame Glory.</p>

'Tis the Souls Market day; now, when a Man goes unto the Market, he conſiders what he wants, and what he needs to buy: Now, a Chriſtian's wants, which he here comes to ſupply, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in his Graces: 'Tis Spiritual wants, Soul wants, that are here ſupplyed; if Grace be wanting, there is no ſupply promiſed: but if it be weak, there is: Food may nouriſh a weak Man, and make him ſtronger, but it will not give Life to a dead Carkaſs: The Sacrament is not a begetting, but a nouriſhing Ordinance, and God gives none leave to ſit at his Table but ſuch as are his Children: Who will invite a dead Man to a Feaſt? Now, though all God's Children have the Truth of Grace, yet have they many defects in Grace. A Child that hath Life, muſt have Food to maintain Life, and to bring him to his Maturity, and full growth. Now, the wants we ſhould examine before the Sacrament, are either defects in Grace, and decays of Grace, for here is a ſupply to be had for both, if we make a right
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40419:115"/> improvement of this Ordinance: Defects in Grace are often diſcerned by the prevailing of Corruption, examine thy ſelf well concerning the ſtate of thy Soul, caſt an Eye over the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral paſſages of thy Life, and bring thy Thoughts, and Words, and Actions to the Rule, and compare them with the Word of God; hereby thou maiſt ſee what is ſtrait, what is crooked; look into this Glaſs of the Law, and thou wilt ſee thy own ſpots; when thou compareſt it with the Rule, thou wilt ſee thy Deviations, and wilt find where thou haſt come ſhort, and where thou haſt gone out of the way: Make a Catalogue of thy ſins, eſpecially thoſe ſince thy Converſion, and ſince thy laſt renenewig thy Covenant with God, by this Sacrament; and conſider thy ſins, with their ſeveral aggravations, and when thou ſeeſt what thou ſhouldſt have done, and what thou haſt done, compare the one with the other, and compare the difference, and ſee how ſhort thou comeſt; 'tis the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Search and try your ways, and turn unto the Lord.</hi> Come then to God with ſhame in thy Face, and ſorrow in thy Heart, and, if poſſible, with Tears in thine Eyes; confeſs theſe thy ſins, with their aggravations: <hi>Aaron</hi> was Commanded to lay his Hands upon the Head of the <hi>Scape-Goat,</hi> and <hi>confeſs over him all the Iniquities of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and all their tranſgreſſions and ſins,</hi> Lev. 16.21. Chriſt is our Scape-Goat, let him bear all our Iniquities. To name thy
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40419:115"/> ſin, without ſorrow, is but an aggravation of it; mourn for it therefore, but let the Love of God, and not the fear of puniſhment, be the ſtrongeſt Motive to Repentance: When thou ſeeſt Chriſt Crucified afreſh before thine Eyes in the Ordinance, conſider, and ſay to thy ſelf, Oh, what a wretch was I, to pluck him out of the Arms of his Father, and cauſe him to ſuffer ſuch Helliſh Torments for my ſake; it was my ſin that were the Nails that pierced his Hands, and his Feet, the Spear that woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Side, the Thorns that pricked his Head, the Traytor that betrayed him, the Judge that Condemned him, and the Executioner that put him to Death. It was not the Devil, nor his Inſtruments, the <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor all the wicked Men in the World, could have done it, had it not been for the ſins of his Elect: Me-thinks the conſideration of this ſhould work upon an Ingenious Heart; and when thou haſt confeſt thy ſin, reſolve to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it; God makes no promiſe of Pardon to any other: And look ſtedfaſtly upon Chriſt offered to thee in the Sacrament, for Pardon of ſin, and power againſt it, he is a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>The Lamb of God, that takes away the Sins of the World,</hi> John 1.29. Having now found out thy defects of Grace, for 'tis weakneſs of Grace that makes us run into ſin: Go to God for a ſupply, Chriſt is ready with ſupplies; if thou be but ſenſible of thy wants, come to the Ordinance in God's way, and where thou art weak Chriſt will
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40419:116"/> ſtrengthen thee, and where Corruptions are ſtrong, he will weaken them: Be not aſhamed to ſhew to him thy nakedneſs; unlap thy Sores, that thou mayſt have a Plaiſter, and Chriſt will be thy Chyrurgeon, and Phyſitian. In thy decays of Grace, though there be great cauſe of ſhame and ſorrow, yet none of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; there are Recovering Plaiſters, as well as Healing; be but ſenſible of thy want, and go boldly for a ſupply.

A Workman that would Live by his Works, ſees that his Tools be ſharp, and fit for the work, without them we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; nay, if they be dull, or blunt, the work will not go forward; and therefore let us ſtir up our Graces, as <hi>Deborah</hi> did her Soul, when ſhe was to ſing forth the praiſes of the Lord, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Awake, awake,</hi> Deborah; <hi>awake, awake, utter a Song,</hi> &amp;c.

Quicken thy Love to God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and this thou mayſt do by the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Love to thee, and what he hath done for thee, eſpecially in the work of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, held out in this Ordinance of the Sacrament: Hadſt thou had a Temporal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Slavery, thou wouldſt have been thankful to thy Deliverer, and have Loved him for it; much more then is due to him that Redeemed thee from the guilt of ſin, and from the filth of ſin, and from the puniſhment due to ſin; from the Curſe of the Law, the wrath of God, the Slavery of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and from Everlaſting Damnation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new thy fear of him alſo, conſider the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of his wrath, againſt Sin, and Sinners, when thou ſeeſt it was ſo hot againſt his own Son, when he ſtood in the room of Sinners; and let this make thee fear to Offend. This
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40419:117"/> alſo may quicken thy Love to thy Brethren; yea, to thine Enemies, when thou conſidereſt how dearly God Loves thy Brethren in Chriſt, and what he ſuffered for them; and to thine Enemies, when thou conſidereſt the Torments which Chriſt indured for thy ſake, when thou waſt his Enemy, and Commands thee to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in Loving thoſe that hate thee. But eſpecially quicken, and Exerciſe thy Faith, for this is all, and in all, in this Duty, and much conduceth to the well performing of it: 'Tis true, Chriſt hath all fulneſs in himſelf to fill empty Souls; he is the Bread and Water of Life, to feed and Refreſh the Hungry and Thirſty; of his Fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace, <hi>John</hi> 1.14.16. In him all Fulneſs dwells, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. There is in him both ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Merit, and fulneſs of Spirit; Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, Sanctifying, Quickning Virtue: Here Soul-wants may be ſupplyed. But the way of obtaining this at God's Hands, the way of emptying of Chriſt into the Soul, is by the way of Ordinances; the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the Breaſts of Conſolation, from whence we muſt ſuck and be ſatisfied: Theſe are the Pipes through which the Water of Life run, from the Fountain into the Ciſtern; from Chriſt to our Hearts. Chriſt is the Olive, and theſe the Golden Pipes, that convey the Oyl into the Candleſtick, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.12. 'Tis true, he could convey it immediately, and empty himſelf into the Soul, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument at all, but this is not uſual, where
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40419:117"/> the Word and Ordinances are to be had. But that we may get benefit by the Ordinances: Faith is neceſſary, the Well is deep, and Faith is the Bucket to draw up this water of Life; and though the Conduit be full of water, and we empty Veſſels, yet if we bring them not thither, they will ſtill remain empty; nay, though we bring them, and place them under the Cock, if we turn not the Cock they are empty ſtill: The Child that plays with the Breaſt, is not ſatisfied till it ſuck: Thou muſt ſuck Honey and Oyl out of this flinty Rock, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.13. Faith is the Souls Eye, which muſt be fixed upon Chriſt; the Souls Hand, to lay hold upon Chriſt; the Souls Mouth, to feed upon him: Chriſt, and all his Benefits are offered in the Sacrament, but without Faith they cannot be laid hold upon.</p>

Come with the Heart humbled, God cannot endure a proud Perſon, eſpecially in an Ordinance, that hold forth, that which may humble thee; here is Chriſt Crucified, and his Blood ſhed for thy ſin; thou waſt the Traytor that betrayed him, the Judge that Condemned him, and the Executioner that put him Death; and will not this work upon thee? Is it nothing to have Blood lying upon thee, the Blood of the Innocent, the Blood of a Friend, the Blood of a King; yea, the Blood of the Son of God?

When thou beholdeſt the Miniſter, who ſtands in the place of God, ſetting apart, and Conſecrating the Bread and Wine, by the Word and Prayer, will not this bring to thy Mind, the Love of God to thy Soul? Who from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſet apart his only Son, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be thy Mediator, and Advocate; thy Surety, and thy Saviour; well may it be ſaid, <hi>God
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40419:118"/> ſo Loved the World,</hi> &amp;c. May not the thoughts of this furniſh thee with Heart-raiſing, Heart-warming Meditations. And when thou ſeeſt thee Bread broken, and the Wine poured out, doth not this Lively repreſent the bitter Death, and bloody Paſſion of the Son of God, <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> thy ſweet Saviour, and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; his Body was broken, his precious blood was ſhed for the Remiſſion of thy ſins, which otherwiſe could not have been forgiven. Ah! what a wicked thing then is ſin, when nothing would ſatisfie Divine Juſtice but the death of the only begotten Son of God? When the Bread and Wine thus ſeparated, thus ſet apart, from common uſe, are held forth to thee, apprehend God himſelf, giving Chriſt, yea, Chriſt offering himſelf with all his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to be thy Husband, thy Surety, thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and thy Saviour: Ah! what Soul-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing thoughts may this produce? Well mayſt thou ſay, with <hi>David, Lord, what is Man, that thou art mindful of him?</hi> Or rather, <hi>Lord, what am I, that thou regardeſt me, and haſt provided ſuch a Feaſt of Fat things for me, with Wine on the Lees?</hi> When thouſands are laid aſide as good as I by Nature. And when thou receiveſt the Elements at the Miniſters hand, let thy Faith lay faſt hold, and claſp faſt about the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and take him, as given by God, to be thy Husband; and Reſolve that the Devil and all his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall never draw off thy Affections from him; but thou wilt, all others being forſaken,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40419:119"/> prove his faithful Spouſe. And when thou Eateſt, and Drinkeſt the Bread and Wine, let thy Faith feed upon thoſe Spiritual dainties, hereby repreſented, upon this <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia;</hi> this Bread, and this Water of Life: Receive him, and all the Benefits of the New Covenant by Faith, and in the whole Action let thy Heart Cloſe with God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and let the whole bent of thy Soul be ſet upon him, and by ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſtir up thy Heart to bleſs God, and praiſe him for his Mercy, and to Love him above all, and to vow Obedience to him; and as thou lookeſt upon thy ſin with one Eye, to hate and abominate it, ſo look upon Chriſt with the other, to keep thee from deſpair; as he is offered up in the Sacrament, a Sacrifice to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, and beg of God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, yet believingly that he will accept of this Sacrifice as ſatisfactory for thy ſin, and pardon what is paſt, and give thee power againſt Sin for the time to come. Conſider alſo the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and receiving of this Sacrament, is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ratification of the Covenant, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherein God offers Chriſt and all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; and promiſes to be thy God, and the God of thy Seed: And thou promiſeſt that thou and thine will Serve the Lord. Let this ſtrengthen thy Faith in his Promiſes, for he will never break his word; and let it ſtrengthen thy Reſolution, that thou wilt never break with him, then this will be to thee an Happy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldſt receive Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the Sacrament, behave thy ſelf well after thou haſt received it. All thy work is not done; nay, moſt is to be done when thou haſt turned thy back upon the Congregation; 'tis not the making a Vow, but the making it good, the fulfilling of it, that is the moſt of the work; 'tis not the preparing for the Duty, or carrying thy ſelf well in the Act of Receiving (though this be neceſſary) that is ſufficient, God expects ſome after-work: A Servant that is refreſht with wholſom meat, and drink, ought not to be Idle, nor to ſpend his time vainly, there is a greater tye lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to diligence and pains taking. So he that comes from ſuch a Feaſt, and is refreſhed with ſuch Dainties, ſhould be more Active, Lively, Quick, and Diſpoſed to Spiritual Exerciſes; plung not thy ſelf too ſuddenly into worldly buſineſs, diſtract not thy thoughts about things here below; for, as in ſweats, 'tis dangerous to cool over-ſuddenly: So 'tis here, when the Affections are raiſed to Heaven, let them not ſuddenly grovel upon the ground; when they are heated, let not the cold wind of the World ſuddenly benumb them: And when thou doſt ſet about Worldly buſineſs, remember there is a buſineſs of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment lyes upon thy Hands; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do all in Subordination to God, Redeem ſome time for Divine Meditation, to conſider what thou haſt been about, and with whom thou haſt had to deal? Thou haſt been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40419:120"/> that Covenant between God and thy Soul, which was made in Baptiſm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look to it that thou make it good. It is better not to Vow, than to Vow and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Conſider whether God makes good his Promiſe Sealed by this Sacrament; if not, doubtleſs, the fault is thine own: God gives thee Chriſt, and thou giveſt him thy ſelf; if thou hold, God will not flinch: He promiſes Heaven, and Happineſs; and thou promiſeſt Love, and Obedience: And thoſe Vows which thou madeſt in Baptiſm, and reneweſt in this Sacrament, muſt be fulfilled; 'tis an horrible thing to prove Treacherous to this God, and to break Covenant with him; God will avenge the Quarrel of his Covenant. 'Tis a dangerous thing to have God for an Enemy, and our Conſciences for our Accuſers; reſolve therefore to make good thy Engagements, and fulfill thy Vows. Conſider in the Sacrament what Entertainment thou haſt met with from God, and what welcome he hath given thee; haſt thou ſped, or no? Did he meet thee in the Ordinance, or haſt thou had an Anſwer of thy Prayers, or haſt been fruſtrated of thy hopes and expectations? If ſo, examine thy Preparations, and demeanour before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Duty, haply thou maiſt find ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage; if ſo, humble thy ſelf, and be more careful for the future; take notice of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, and be humbled, yet deſpair not: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Ordinance may be more beneficial after, than at preſent, as the Sacrament of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40419:120"/> Baptiſm uſually is. If thou haſt met with ſome Fruit, but not ſo much as thou expecteſt, or deſireſt, conſider thou art not to be thy own Carver; he deals his Mercies as he ſees beſt, thou muſt wait upon him in a longing Poſture, it will come in the moſt ſuitable Seaſon; if thou haſt found any, 'tis more than thy deſert, bleſs God for it, from whoſe bounty it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds: If it be not ſo much as thou expecteſt, 'tis more than thou deſerveſt; 'tis to be owned, he that is not thankful for a little, God will not truſt him with much: Thou giveſt him thanks for Bodily Food, and wilt be thankful for Crumbs, and not for Chriſt? For Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Favours, and not for Spiritual Mercies? And this ſhould be expreſſed in deeds, as well as words; thou ſhouldeſt live thanks as well as ſpeak thanks: And as Chriſt gives himſelf to thee, ſo give up, not only thy Name, but thy Heart to him; keep alive in thy Soul the Spiritual Fervor, and maintain thy ground againſt thy Corruptions: See how thy Graces grow, and how thy Corruptions dye; this is the way to grow in Grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: Walk in the ſtrength of one Ordinance to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thus doing, thou wilt be a growing Chriſtian, and thou wilt find, through the Bleſſing of God upon thine Endeavours, that the Sacrament, which many get little benefit by, is indeed a Soul-fatting Ordinance.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. Directions about Oaths.</head>
                  <p>THE next part of Divine Worſhip that I ſhall Direct you in, is the right Uſe of an Oath; for though raſh ſwearing be an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſin, as I intend, God willing, elſewhere to demonſtrate. Yet an Oath in it ſelf is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and neceſſary; yea, a Commanded part of God's Worſhip, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord, and ſerve him, and ſhalt ſwear by his Name,</hi> Deut. 6.13. The like we find, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. My work therefore, in the firſt place, will be to ſhew you what an Oath is, and then to prove it Lawful, and afterwards to give you Directions in this, as I have done in other parts of God's Worſhip. An Oath is a part of that Religious Worſhip which we owe to God, in which, being Lawfully called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, we call God to witneſs the Truth of what we Aſſert, and our real intention to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what we promiſe, and to reward, or puniſh us according to the Truth, or Falſhood of what we ſay. That it is a part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip, the Texts before quoted ſerve to prove, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Moreover, I call God for a Record upon my Soul, that to ſpare you I came not as yet unto</hi> Corinth. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.22,23. <hi>If a Man ſin againſt his Neighbour, and an
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40419:121"/> Oath be laid upon him, to make him Swear, and the Oath come before thine Altar, in this Houſe, then hear thou from Heaven, and do, and Judge thy Servants by requiting the Wicked, by Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing his way upon his own Head, and by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying the Righteous, by giving him according to his Righteouſneſs,</hi> Lev. 19.12. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſwear by my Name falſly, neither ſhalt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Name of thy God,</hi> Exod. 2.7. You ſee 'tis a part of Religious Worſhip, for herein God is called to be a Witneſs to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, or to Condemn; who only knows the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Heart, and the ſincerity of the Intentions; yea, ſometimes 'tis put for the whole Worſhip of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.18. Where ſwearing to the Lord is meant worſhipping the Lord: Nay, we have the conſent of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that always have eſteemed an Oath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and Venerable. <hi>Poets, Philoſophers, Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> make Conſcience of this Religious Band, and Reaſon ſhews it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for hereby we acknowledge the Wiſdom, Power, and Juſtice of God: His Wiſdom in Searching the Heart, and knowing the hidden thoughts, and intentions of it: His Power, in being able to puniſh it, and his Juſtice, in giving every Man accoding to his deſert; and this Worſhip he will not give to another, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.16. <hi>They taught my People to Swear by the Name of</hi> Baal, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.14. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.5. The Lawfulneſs of an Oath is confeſſed by moſt, and denyed by few, and thoſe Contemptible, we have Scripture warrant for it; yea, the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40419:122"/> Command of God, as you have heard, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.10. Where an Oath was to be taken in the Caſe of loſt Goods, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.63. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me every Tongue ſhall ſwear,</hi> Iſa. 65.16. <hi>He that ſweareth in the Earth ſhall ſwear by the God of Truth.</hi> Now, God would not have Commanded any thing that was ſinful in it ſelf, as a part of his Worſhip. Nay, he doth not only Command it, but lays down the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of an Oath, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord Liveth in Truth, in Judgment, and in Righteouſneſs;</hi> and in what Caſes it ought to be required, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.11. Neither can there any Reaſon be given, why 'tis not Lawful as well in Goſpel times, as under the Law; it was not Ceremonious, nor Typical, neither in the Matter, Form, nor End: Nay, we have Examples of God himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not intrinſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

This is called God's Oath, and frequent are the Aſſervations of Chriſt: Verily, verily, we have the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Angels alſo, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The Angel lift up his Hand, and ſware by him that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40419:122"/> Liveth for ever.</hi> The like we have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6. we read of the Saints Swearing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. &amp; 42.15. <hi>Joſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 14.9. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.3. Yea, in Goſpel times, <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1.9. <hi>God is my Witneſs, whom I ſerve in my Spirit, I ſay the Truth in Chriſt I lye not, my Conſcience alſo bearing me Witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. We have the Cuſtom of all Nations, which ſhews 'tis a Principle in Nature; who, when wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is wanting, take an Oath as a Religious Band; and becauſe they know not the Heart, appeal to God, that doth know it: Neither is there any thing in an Oath that is intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Evil; neither the Matter, Form, nor End, the calling upon God, the Searcher of the Heart, to bear witneſs to the Sincerity of our Intentions, for the Satisfaction of others, that cannot otherwiſe be ſatisfied; what Evil can there be in that? <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>An Oath is for Confirmation, the end of all ſtrife,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.23. Indeed all raſh common Swearing is forbidden by Chriſt, and alſo by St. <hi>James.</hi>

                     </label> As concerning Oaths, Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt be had of the parties themſelves concerned; and they are either the Parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring an Oath, or the Parties of whom an Oath is required, for both of them require ſome Satisfaction: He that requires it ſhould do it by Authority, and have a Lawful ground, or otherwiſe he cannot; he ought not to exact it by force: every Man cannot force another to Swear, and without juſt Cauſe no one ought; in ſuch a Caſe they ought not to be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40419:123"/> Obeyed: And for the Perſon Swearing, which is <hi>Agens Principalis,</hi> the chief Actor in the buſineſs: 'Tis neceſſary that he have the uſe of Reaſon, and that he be <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> his own Man; and the things that he ſwears to give be at his own Diſpoſe; and hence it follows, the Children, before they come to the right uſe of Reaſon, ought not to take an Oath, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed ſhould their Oaths be impoſed, or regarded; neither doth ſuch an Oath bind the Conſcience, being Ignorantly taken; they are Ignorant of the Nature of an Oath, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they come with deliberation as they ought, or compare their Action with the Rule, or right Reaſon; therefore they ought not to be Admitted. But at what Age that is, I think is not eaſie to determine; for doubtleſs, ſome attain it ſoon, ſome later; but I think our Laws ſay Sixteen Years of Age, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time their Teſtimony is not Valid: And an Oath may bind the Conſcience of ſome, if otherwiſe Lawful, though the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony be not Valid by the Law. But alas! how Common, oh, too Common, is that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Swearing of Children, even before they can ſpeak plain, as if they ſuckt it in with their Mothers Milk, and had been taught it with their Mother Tongue, as doubtleſs, they are, either by Precept, or Example; for how many, before they can ſpeak plain, liſp out Oaths againſt God himſelf, whoſe Name they Profanely abuſe, to the diſhonour of God, the ſhame of their Parents, the damage of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40419:123"/> the Nation where they Live; <hi>for becauſe of Oaths the Land mourns;</hi> and to the apparent hazard of their own Souls; who, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, will Eternally Curſe their Parents in Hell for their ſinful Education. Again, Mad and Frantick Men are not fit to take an Oath for the ſame Reaſon; for though they once had the uſe of Reaſon, yet through their Diſtemper, 'tis loſt. The like we may ſay of Fools and Idiots, that never had it, and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew the uſe of an Oath; though too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, though they cannot ſpeak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, can Swear, and Curſe, and take the Name of God in vain; and their proneneſs to this, and other ſins, and their backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to what is good, diſcovers them to be of the Sinful Off-ſpring of lapſed <hi>Adam,</hi> and is a ſtrong Argument for Original Sin; and their want of the uſe of Reaſon is ſome extenuation of their Sin: God requires little where little was given, yet it excuſeth not <hi>a toto,</hi> but <hi>a tanto;</hi> it diſcovers a foul Fountain, that thus bubbles up; their Words, their Actions, their Diſcourſe is not to be heard, why then their Oaths? Again, Men, when far gone in Drink, or Paſſion, are not fit for this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Duty, neither can they do it without Sin, becauſe not with Mature Deliberation; though ſome Caſes their promiſory Oaths may bind them, and they ought not to break them, though it be to their own damage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. For Drunkenneſs, or Immoderate Paſſion is no Excuſe of their Sin, but an Aggravation;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40419:124"/> for one Sin will not Excuſe another. Again, if a Man be in his right mind, and otherwiſe qualified, yet 'tis neceſſary that he be <hi>ſui juris,</hi> his own Man, at his own diſpoſe, and not anothers, in the thing he ſwears, otherwiſe he cannot avoid ſin, what Courſe ſoever he take: As, ſuppoſe a Son under the Tuition of a Father, or a Servant of a Maſter, ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Parents, or Maſters Conſent, ſwear to go a Journey; as ſuppoſe in Popery, on a Pilgrimage; this is a Sin, becauſe he is not at his own diſpoſe: We read in the time of the Law, if a Woman Vowed a Vow, or a Maid in her Fathers Houſe, if her Husband or Father approved not of it, it was void; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then whether Vows of ſingle Life, or Marriage Promiſes without Parents conſent, be valid; I am ſure they are ſinful: Thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Authority ſhould not diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Oath, without Parents Conſent.</p>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40419:124"/> 
                     <hi>Jacob ſware by the fear of his Father</hi> Iſaac; that is, by the God whom his Father feared: That we ought to ſwear by God, I have ſhewed you already, both by Scriptures and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. &amp; 10.20. and many more: But where we have any Injunction, or Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, given to ſwear by any thing that is not God, is not eaſie to find; yea, it is plain Idolatry, to aſcribe unto any Creature Divine Worſhip; 'tis a ſetting of them in the place of God, yea, a diſhonouring of God, and ſetting up ſomething elſe in his ſtead. In a Lawful Oath we do not only aſſert the Truth for that we do, or ought to do without an Oath, but we aſcribe Omniſcience, Omnipotence, Omnipreſence; yea, the Juſtice, wiſdom, and Truth to God: we acknowledge him to be the Searcher of the Heart, and the Tryer of the Reins; and that he is both the witneſs, Judge, and Revenger of Falſhood, and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and furthermore, by Prayer, and Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation God is called upon to give Teſtimony, with the Conſcience of him that ſweareth, that he ſpeaketh the Truth from his Heart, with an Imprecation in which a Man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that God is a juſt Revenger of a Lye, and binds himſelf to be puniſhed by him if he ſwear falſly, or ſpeaks an untruth wittingly or willingly: &amp; now I appeal to any Man's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if theſe things can be Attributed to any Creature, without groſs Idolatry; can we aſcribe to the Creature Omniſcience, Omnipotence, Searching the Heart, and witneſſing with the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40419:125"/> Conſcience, that we ſpeak the Truth, and an ability to puniſh, or reward according to the Integrity of the Heart; to protect the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and detect the Guilty? what is this, but to make them Gods, in giving to them the Incommunicable Attributes of God? Can all this be done without Idolatry? VVe may find God in Scripture complaining of this Sin, and threatning to puniſh ſuch Sinners, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>They have forſaken me, and ſworn by them that are no Gods:</hi> See Swearing by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is in God's Account, and Scripture Language, a forſaking of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.16. <hi>They have taught my People to ſwear by the Name of</hi> Baal. God threatens ſuch as Swear by the Sin of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that they ſhall fall, and never riſe again, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.8. Now, this was ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Idols of <hi>Samaria,</hi> for <hi>Samaria</hi> was full of Idols: Let thoſe look to it, that ſwear by the Popiſh Idol the Maſs, or by our Lady, which they make their great Idol, and ſet her up as high, and in ſome caſes higher than Chriſt himſelf. Nay, thoſe that in their Oaths joyn any thing with God, as if he were not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficient, cannot be Excuſed, as thoſe, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.4,5. <hi>That ſwear by God and</hi> Malchom; and the Excuſe which many make, for this horrid Crime, is indeed the aggravation of the Sin; they ſay, what they ſwear by are petty trivial things, and therefore no Offence; they take not the Name of God in Vain: But is not the Offence the greater, when we give the Incommunicable Attribute of God to thoſe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40419:125"/> petty things; if there be no need of an Oath, why doſt thou ſwear? If there be, why doſt not ſwear by God, when thou haſt ſo many direct Commands, and ſo many Examples of God, Angels, and the beſt of Men. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Practice of ſome of the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, an Excuſe ſufficient; <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſwearing by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> is by moſt, if not all Learned Expoſitors, judged his failing, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Cuſtom in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and will no more warrant the Practice, than <hi>Noah</hi>'s, <hi>Lot</hi>'s, and <hi>David</hi>'s Example will Drunkenneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, Murder, or Adultery: And whereas ſome uſe the Expreſſion, <hi>as thy Soul Liveth,</hi> &amp;c. This is not properly an Oath, but an Aſſervera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein God is alſo tacitely invoked to witneſs the Truth; it ſignifies ſuch a thing is as really True, as thou art alive, yet doth invoke his to witneſs this Truth; 'tis hard to ſay which is the greater Sin, to ſwear raſhly by God, which is Blaſphemy, or to Swear by the Creatures, which is Idolatry.</p>

                     </label> Having ſhewed you who may ſwear, and by whom; I ſhall, in the next place, ſpeak of the Matter of an Oath, and here alſo many Offend. An Oath, for the Matter, muſt be about Lawful things, and poſſible, or elſe it cannot be a Lawful Oath: If we ſwear to do an unlawful thing, we muſt not perform it, for 'tis a double Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; if to do an impoſſible thing, we cannot do it; a raſh Oath is better broken than kept: VVhat a Snare then do Men run into, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40419:126"/> how do they put themſelves upon a Neceſſity of ſinning, that ſwear in their Rage to do what God forbids them to do? Swear to do that which they muſt not perform: See this in <hi>David,</hi> when he had raſhly ſworn the death of <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his Houſhold, many of them, no doubt, Innocent Perſons, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was pacified by wiſe <hi>Abigail,</hi> and bleſſeth God for the preventing the ſhedding of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32,33. The like Oath we read of <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſwore the Death of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Jonathan,</hi> but was prevented by the People. When <hi>Herod</hi> performed his raſh Oath to <hi>Herodias</hi>'s Daughter, and cut off <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Head. But a Lawful Oath is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the mind and will of God, about things Honeſt, Juſt, Good, Poſſible, and Weigty, and in thy Power: If it be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, then thou canſt not do it, and therefore thou ſhouldeſt make no ſuch promiſory Oath. Now, a thing may be impoſſible ſeveral ways, as in Nature; as for a Man to flye, or a Fiſh to ſpeak: Some things, though poſſible in Nature, yet impoſſible in regard of Time, or other-like Circumſtances; 'tis poſſible to go to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and to <hi>Rome,</hi> but 'tis impoſſible to be at both places the ſame day: And ſome things may be poſſible in Nature, yet impoſſible by Accident; as for a Man to ſwear to come to ſ ch a place, by ſuch a time, and he be taken Captive by the Enemy, or fall dangerouſly Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſuch a Caſe 'tis well to put in ſuch a Caution, <hi>If God permit;</hi> the bond of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40419:126"/> ſuch an Oath is looſed, as it was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant, in caſe the Maid would not come with him. Again, we ought not to ſwear to perform unlawful things, any thing which is the breach of God's Law; as to kill a Man, to Steal, or to Commit Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is againſt Piety towards God, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards Man: Whatſoever is againſt the good of the Church, or the Glory of God, and the Common-wealth thou Liveſt in: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath any evil in it, ought not to be the Matter of an Oath; for an Oath ought not to be <hi>Vinculun Iniquitatis,</hi> a band of Iniquity. No Man is, or can be tyed to break God's Law; or if ſuch an Oath be taken, it ought not to be kept: Hence <hi>Herod</hi> ſins both in Swearing, and alſo in performing his Oath. But ſome will ſay, if he had not performed it he had been perjured: I Anſwer, when a Man ſwears to break a Command of God, he is perjured as ſoon as he hath ſworn, becauſe he took an unlawful Oath; and if he perform it he adds ſin to ſin, as <hi>Herod</hi> did Murther to Perjury; and ſuch a Man muſt Repent of his raſh Oath, and not add ſin to ſin, in perſiſting in his raſhneſs, to the further breaking of Gods Commands. The Holy Ghoſt gives us a Rule for ſwearing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord Liveth, in Truth, in Judgment, and in Righteouſneſs.</hi> In Truth, for otherwiſe thou wilt forſwear thy ſelf; for thou muſt not take an Oath againſt thy Conſcience, nor of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, which thou knoweſt not to be true.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40419:127"/> Now, there is a double Truth, one of the Tongue, and another of the Mind; that of the Tongue is when a thing is really ſo, as 'tis atteſted; that of the Mind, when a Man thinks in his Conſcience he ſpeaks nothing but the Truth; In Judgment not raſh, or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly, but with due Conſideration of the Nature of the thing, to be worthy the weight of an Oath, the Nature of God, whom we call to witneſs, and under whoſe Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſet our ſelves, in Caſe we ſpeak falſe; and in Righteouſneſs, that the thing we ſwear be Lawful, and poſſible, and like to bring Glory to God, and good to our ſelves, or others.</p>

                     </label> The next thing to be conſidered, is the form of an Oath, for this alſo is ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at by ſome, and is to be minded as well as the Matter; this ſhould be agreeable, or at leaſt not contradictory to the word of God. Now, the Form of an Oath is either Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or Internal; the External Form conſiſts in words, or ſigns, or both; the Internal Form conſiſts in the true Senſe and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words of the Oath; a little of theſe in their Order. The External ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſiſts in words, without ſigns, and thus a Man ſwears, and calls God to witneſs the Truth of his Intentions in plain words; and this Oath is variouſly worded, according to the Uſe, and Cuſtom of the Countrey Men Live in: And thus we may find, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been proved, God, Angels, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40419:127"/> Men have thus ſworn. Sometimes alſo Men ſwear, and affirm by ſigns without words, and this is moſt frequent where there are many that enter into an Oath, or Covenant, when the words of the Oath, or Covenant are either read, or ſpoken; and thoſe that are willing to enter into that bond, make it known by ſome External ſign or token, by ſome Action or Geſture, as by a nod with the Head, bowing the Body, ſtanding up, or to a ſide, lifting up the Hand, or otherwiſe, according as they ſhall be required by the Impoſer; or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down their Names: By any of thoſe they may teſtifie their conſent, and this is as binding and Obligatory, as if the words were uttered. And ſometimes we may find an Oath taken both by words and ſigns, and this is the moſt Solemn manner of Swearing: Thus God frequently is ſaid to lift up his Hand, when he ſwears to his People; thus the Angel, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. he held up his Right Hand; and his Left Hand to Heaven, and ſware by him that Liveth for ever; and this hath been the Cuſtom of Heathens, and Infidels, as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in making Oaths, and Covenants: Divers are the Rites and Ceremonies which the Heathens have uſed at ſuch times; yea, many and various are the Cuſtomes of the Godly in ſuch Caſes: One was the putting the Hand under the Thigh; thus <hi>Abraham</hi> ſware his Servant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.2. And thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſware unto his Father <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 47.29. Another Form much in Uſe, was lifting up the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40419:128"/> Hand, as was even now ſpoken of; this was uſed by God, Angels, and Men; by God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.40. <hi>For I lift up my Hand, and ſay, I Live for ever.</hi> By <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 19.22. <hi>I have lift up my Hand unto the Lord moſt High;</hi> and falſe ſwearers are ſaid to have a Right Hand of Deceit, becauſe they lift it up de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.8 11. And various have been the Ceremonies that have been uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians in the Primitive Times, and in ſucceeding Generations; among us the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the hand upon the Bible, and kiſſing it is moſt in Uſe, or both; which is but a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſign of our conſent, and I know not any cauſe of Scruple in it; thus for the External. The Internal Form of an Oath is the right ſenſe and Interpretation of the words; and therefore an Oath ſhould not conſiſt in aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, or ambiguous words, or phraſes; for then a Man may take them in a different ſenſe from the Impoſers mind, and may require one thing, and another may atteſt another; but the ſenſe ſhould be obvious to both giver and taker, or otherwiſe nothing; or at leaſt we know not what is witneſſed, and the Oath proves vain; nay, the very end of an Oath, which is the Inveſtigation of Truth, is cloſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>An Oath is the end of ſtrife;</hi> and thus the Name of God is taken in vain, and this part of his Worſhip prophaned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed; and 'tis no better than a Lye, when we affirm by Oath, what in the Impoſers ſenſe is not true, and ſo it proves Perjury: But
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40419:128"/> the words ſhould be taken in the plain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, which is obvious to all. Neither ſhould there be equivocation, or Mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation uſed in an Oath; this is the ſallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealing of the Papiſts, who by this means think to evade all Oaths, and delude the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, but they moſt delude themſelves, and wrong their own Souls; for God will not be mocked, whoſe Worſhip is abuſed: They hide part in their Minds, and ſo ſubvert the ſenſe; as thus, they ſwear they were not at <hi>Rome,</hi> and think in their Minds, not an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years agoe; but what is <hi>mentire,</hi> but <hi>contra mentum ire,</hi> though this may ſerve, <hi>in foro humano,</hi> God can eaſily detect ſuch jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling deceits, and will never hold thoſe guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that thus take his Name in Vain, and, like <hi>Jezebel,</hi> deceive under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldſt honour God in this part of his Worſhip, ſee then that thou aimeſt at right Ends. In thy Oath, the End muſt be Lawful, and good, or the Duty will prove a Sin, and a Snare. A Man may ſwear that which is Truth, and yet if his End be bad, it will prove his Sin. Now, the End of an Oath, as I ſaid before, ſhould be for the Confirmation of ſome neceſſary Truth in Queſtion, which cannot otherwiſe be proved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Men ſwear by him that is greater than themſelves, and an Oath for confirmation to them is the End of all ſtrife.</hi> Now, it ſhould be a weighty buſineſs that requires an Oath,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40419:129"/> and a neceſſary Truth that is in Queſtion, ſome doubtful Matter, which cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be found out, or proved, that cannot be Evidenced, but by an Oath. In this Caſe we find the Apoſtle vindicating himſelf this way, when there was no other way to do it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is my Witneſs, whom I ſerve with my Spirit, that without ceaſing, I make mention of you always in my Prayers,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.23. <hi>I call God to Record, upon my Soul,</hi> &amp;c. We ſee he appeals to God, the Searcher of all Hearts, to witneſs with him, and for him, his Affection to them. 'Tis the Glory of God in the manifeſtation of Truth; and our own, and Neighbours good ſhould be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally minded in this Duty; but too many have by, and baſe, and low Ends in it, and not accordingly. When a thing depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Faith of the Speaker, and cannot otherwiſe be found out, and yet is neceſſary to be known, an Oath of the Lord may be Impoſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.10,11. <hi>If a Man deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto his Neighbour an Aſs, or an Ox, or a Sheep, or any Beaſt to keep, and it dye, or be hurt, or be driven away, no man ſeeing it, then ſhall an Oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath not put his Hand to his Neighbours goods, and the Owner of it ſhall accept thereof,</hi> &amp;c. There are ſome things that are not fit for an Oath, as thoſe that have been handed down to us, by Tradition; as whether there were ever any ſuch Cities, as <hi>Troy,</hi> or <hi>Carthage,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Sackt, or ſpoyled; though
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40419:129"/> we are confidently aſſured, this is a Truth, we ought not to ſwear it, becauſe 'tis out of the reach of Perſonal knowledge: We muſt ſwear no more than we Perſonally know to be true. Some things alſo are obvious to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, as that a Quadrangle hath four Angles, a Triangle three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe things are not doubtful, and an Oath will not make them more clear; but a thing which cannot otherwiſe be determined, when we dare not reſt upon the Credit of the Revealer, when 'tis doubtful, and cannot be proved but by witneſs; and this witneſs is ſuſpected either to want knowledge, or Conſcience, every Man being a Lyar, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. Now, becauſe there is ſo little Faith and Juſtice among Men, 'tis neceſſary to appeal to God himſelf to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which cannot deceive, nor be deceived; and this is done by an Oath, which is the <hi>ne Plus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra,</hi> the End of Contention: For he that makes no Conſcience of this, is not fit for Humane Society. The very Heathens themſelves, when they ſware by their Idol-gods, were careful of ſwearing falſly; yet among Chriſtians in Name, every one hath not this care; nay, 'tis too evidently known that many take little care of their words, or Oath. But this is a ſtrong Bond, and none will break it that fear God, or make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any thing. But how much do thoſe ſtray from the very End of an Oath, which is the Inveſtigation of Truth, that affirm by an Oath that which they know to be falſe, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40419:130"/> call God to witneſs to a lye; the very Heathens will riſe up in Judgment againſt them, and Condemn them; thoſe that ſeek thereby to hide the Truth, and not to manifeſt it, and mind not God's Glory, but their Neighbours Injury by it, as wicked <hi>Doeg</hi> in his Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>David;</hi> though he ſpeaks the Truth, 'tis to a bad End. Thoſ alſo are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ſwear to that they know not, though it prove to be true, yet they are perjured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they ſwear the knowledge of it which they did not know; thoſe alſo that ſwear vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, idly, and to no purpoſe; thoſe that ſwear and never intend to make good their Oaths, or if they did intend it, do not do it. Surely theſe Men when they call God to witneſs their Lyes, do not believe there is any God, or that he takes any notice of them, or think they can deceive God, as well as Men, or that he approves of it; but he will call them to an Account, and ſet their Oaths in Order againſt them.</p>

It connot but be diſtaſtful to God, who will not hold him guiltleſs, that takes his Name in vain; to have his Name toſſed by every Drunken Sot, upon the Ale Bench; and when Men thunder out Oaths and Curſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, 'tis no wonder if God Thunder out his Judgments from Heaven. When thoſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40419:130"/> ill-boading Fowls feed ſo near the brink of the bottomleſs Pit; 'tis a ſad Preſaging that God's Judgements are near. Cuſtomary ſwearing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without much ſin, for the very Nature of an Oath being an Act of Religious Worſhip to God, ſhews it ſhould be taken upon mature Deliberation, and ſerious Meditation; but Common Experience ſhews in Cuſtomary ſwearing theſe things are wanting, but the Name of God is irreverently toſſed in their filthy Mouths; and thus many Men Curſe away their Bleſſings, for the moſt of Men are guilty this way; they ſwear down Vengeance from Heaven upon them, and oft-times upon their Poſterity; for the Curſe of God haunts the <hi>Houſe of the Swearer,</hi> Zach. 5.3,4. And God will be a ſwift witneſs againſt them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. The Common ſwearers croſs the very End of an Oath, which is, as I ſaid, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of Truth, of ſome neceſſary weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Truth, which cannot otherwiſe be made to appear: But many of their Oaths are ſpent for the obſcuring of Truth, and the Juſtifying of Lyes; and if Truth be ſpoken, 'tis either about ſuch trivial matters, unfit to have the Name of God mentioned, or added to them; neither is it any great matter whether they are affirmed or no, and no Body ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires any ſuch Confirmation by it, or is little the better Credited to the Oaths of a Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Swearer, than they do to their words; for Common Swearers are oft-times account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Common Lyers, and an hundred Oaths will
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40419:131"/> not Sugar ſome of their Stories, and make them fit to be ſwallowed, when they ſpeak, as oft they do, againſt Reaſon, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for many Men uſe their Oaths to fill up, or, as they think, to adorn their Diſcourſe, inſtead of other Eloquence; but ſuch Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Figures may be uſed in an Oration in Hell. They think themſelves the braveſt men, that can ſwear the biggeſt Oaths, and wiſh damnation to themſelves in the fitteſt Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and indeed they are ſome of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſtouteſt Champions: But from ſuch many times an Oath either needs not, or boots not, if they ſpeak Reaſon they may be believed without, if not, an hundred Oaths will not make it paſs for currant. Now, if we ſearch out the Original from whence theſe Oaths proceed, we may find from a ſinful Cuſtom, and a depraved Nature they learnt to ſwear; but, it was when they learnt to talk; and in ſome 'tis more Cuſtom than Curſtneſs: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals them, as with men in ſome Diſtempers, their Excrements paſs from them at unawares, ſo do their Oaths, they know not when they ſwear; but 'tis a bad Cuſtom, which makes God our Enemy, and Hell our Portion: were there but a Law made, that for every Oath they ſware, they ſhould loſe a Joynt, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit a Pound, and duly Executed, it would make men break off ſuch a Cuſtom: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe raſh Oaths proceed from ſome perturbation of the mind; as Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a ſhort madneſs, and indeed 'tis a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40419:131"/> right mad mans part they Act, when another Offends them, and they flye in the Face of God: Sometimes 'tis the Fruit of Gaming, and unlawful Recreation; but ſure 'tis a bad Tree that yieldeth ſuch unſavoury Fruit: Take heed therefore of theſe, and ſwear not at all, but upon juſt Occaſion; an Oath in it ſelf is not ſinful, as is Murder, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no more is it deſirable, for it ſelf; as Love, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but 'tis to be uſed as Phyſick, when other Food will not ſerve, not for, its own ſake, but for Healths ſake, for Truths ſake. 'Tis an Holy thing, and the more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a thing is, the more dangerous, if abuſed; 'tis bad playing with edged Tools, yet many Prophanely call God to Witneſs at their Cards, Dice, Tables, or invoke him to their Aſſiſtance; thoſe make too bold with God, and ſhall have no thanks for their Labour.

                     </label> If thou wouldſt not Offend God by thy Oaths, take heed of falſe Swearing, for this is the moſt dangerous of all. If a Man ſhall Anſwer for every Idle word, as Chriſt himſelf affirms, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. and for every vain Oath, he be lyable to Damnation, as St. <hi>James</hi> affirms, <hi>James</hi> 5.12. much more then for falſe ſwearing, wherein Men call forth God to witneſs to their lye, and ſo in Effect
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40419:132"/> they deny him to be God; but their Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſleepeth not. God tells us, by his Prophet <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.4. <hi>That his Curſe ſhall enter into the Houſe of him that ſweareth falſly, and there remain, and conſume both the Timber and the Stones thereof;</hi> and the Prophet <hi>David</hi> makes it a mark of a Citizen of Heaven, that having ſworn to his Neighbour, will Faithfully perform, though it prove to his own Injury, and diſ-advantage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. And indeed he is not fit for Humane Society, that regards not his Oath, for what Bond will then hold him? Now, there are two ſorts of Oaths, and in either a man may ſorſwear himſelf: There are aſſertatory Oaths, when a man ſaith ſuch and ſuch a thing was done, or it was not done, or it was done thus or thus, or theſe and theſe words were thus ſpoken, and calls God to witneſs the ſame, that he ſpeaks the Truth, the whole Truth, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Truth; if now he knows, that what he ſaith is contrary to the Truth, this is direct Perjury, and a ſin, which, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, will certainly ſink him into Hell, and is a ſhrewd Sign of an Hardened Heart, and a wicked Mind. Nay, if he affirm that to be true upon Oath, which is doubtful to him, and of his own knowledge he knoweth not whether it be true or falſe, he cannot be Excuſed: As if he ſhould upon Oath affirm ſuch a man, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be dead, and know not whether he be Living or dead, he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Sin if it prove true, and the man is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40419:132"/> dead; this doth not Excuſe him, for ought he knew he might be Living. A man ſhould certainly know the Truth of that which he poſitively aſſerts by Oath. Again, there are promiſſory Oaths, in which a Man is bound to another, to do ſuch a thing for him, or give ſuch and ſuch a thing to him; and doth not only promiſe, but Swears to fulfill his Promiſe: As when a man ſwears to be a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Loyal Subject to his Sovereign, or a Faithful Souldier to his Captain, or a Loyal Wife to her Husband; or to give ſuch a thing to his Friend, and calls God to Witneſs the ſincerity of his Heart, and to puniſh him if he prove falſe; and when he takes this Oath intends not to perform the thing Promiſed; this, in God's Account, is Perjury: Though Man cannot perceive it, God doth, who is called to Witneſs the Integrity of his Heart, when there is no ſuch matter. Nay, his Fact is not Excuſed, though the guilt is leſſened, if afterward he perform it; for when he took it, it was with an intent to deceive: Or if he take not his Oath in the known Senſe of him that requires it, this is not Juſtifiable; for an Oath is for the ſecuring, or Satisfaction of the Impoſer, and ought to be without Fraud, or aequivocation, or Mental reſervation in the Senſe of him that Adminiſtreth it. Again, though a man's Intentions be never ſo Sincere when he takes his Oath, if afterward he fail in the performance, if the thing promiſed be Lawful, and poſſible, he cannot clear himſelf
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40419:133"/> from Perjury. And though every falſe Oath be dangerous and deadly, yet there are aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that make ſome worſe than others: As to take a falſe Oath before a Magiſtrate, in a Publick Aſſembly, in a Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, whereby an unjuſt Verdict is procured from the Jury, an unjuſt Sentence from the Judge, whereby the Innocent Perſon loſeth his Life, or Lively-hood; this is worſe than in a private Cauſe, to a private Perſon, in a buſineſs of ſmall Concernment. The Godly, in all Ages, have been very careful to perform their Oaths; as <hi>Joſhua</hi> to the <hi>Gibonites,</hi> though gotten by Fraud, and great Cauſe; God is Offended at the breach of Covenant, as we find many Years after, when <hi>Saul,</hi> in his Zeal, had Slain ſome of them, God brought a three Years Famine upon the Land, and was never ſatisfied, till ſeven of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Sons were Hanged, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.19. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1,2.</p>

                  <p>THe next part of Divine worſhip, if it may properly be called ſo, is a vow; &amp; this alſo, I ſhall give ſome directions in; as being a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of great concernment, and that many have, and the Papiſts this day do much erre in. I ſhall firſt ſhew you what a Vow is, and then ſhew you the ſeveral ſorts of Vows; a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vow, is a ſolemn promiſe made to God, by a fit Perſon, in a fit manner, of ſome lawful thing, which is in his own choice, upon ſome ſpecial occaſion, and for ſome Religious end; I ſay 'tis a ſolemn promiſe, to diſtinguiſh it from a purpoſe, and 'tis either expreſſed in words, as the Vow of <hi>Jephthah</hi> was, Judges 11.30. <hi>And</hi> Jephthah <hi>vowed a Vow unto the Lord, and ſaid, if thou ſhalt without fail deliver the Children of</hi> Ammon <hi>into my hands, what cometh firſt out of the Doors of my Houſe to meet me, ſhall ſurely be the Lords,</hi> &amp;c. or in the heart, as <hi>Hannah</hi> who vowed a Vow, that if God would give her a Man child, that ſhe would dedicate him to the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.13. She ſpake in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; now theſe Religious Vows, are to be made to God alone this we have precepts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40419:134"/> for; but no prcept, or preſident to make Vows to departed Saints, or Angels; <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 76.11. <hi>Vow and pay it unto the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 19.21. <hi>They ſhall Vow a Vow to the Lord, and performe it; Jacob</hi> vowed a Vow to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Iſrael vowed a Vow,</hi> Numb. 21.2. but where read we of any Vows to Angels, or departed Saints; It muſt alſo be made by a fit Perſon, one that is <hi>compos mentis,</hi> in his right mind, children, fools, or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not fit to do it; nay, he ſhould be at his own diſpoſe, eſpecially in the matter which he Vows: a Maid in her Fathers houſe, or a Woman that had a Husband, their Vows were quallified by the Fathers, or Husbands diſlike, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.34. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſhould alſo be of things in their own power, otherwiſe they cannot perform in a fit manner; that is, with Meditation and Conſideration: for ſome lawful thing, for an unlawful thing ought not to be vowed, any more then ſworn: hence the Vow of thoſe <hi>forty that bound themſelves under a Curſe, neither to eat nor drink till they had killed</hi> Paul, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.14. was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; it muſt be upon ſome ſpecial occaſion, and the engageing the heart more againſt ſin, and unto duty, and to ſome ſpiritual end, as Gods glory, and our own good: now a Vow being of the nature of a promiſſary Oath, it ought to be performed with like care, &amp; taken with the like deliberation, &amp; fulfilled with the like fidelity, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 54.56. <hi>When thou voweſt a Vow to to God, deferre not to pay it, for he hath
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40419:134"/> no pleaſure in fools, pay that which thou haſt vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Iſa. 19.21. Pſal. 61.8, <hi>&amp;</hi> 66.13.19. now a Vow is either general, or ſpecial; a general Vow I call that which concerns all Believers, at all times, and in all ages, and this is that Covenant wherein God and Man are mutually ingaged, and obliged each to other; wherein God for his part promiſeth Chriſt, and all the bleſſings of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Man promiſes to forſake all other, and keep cloſe to God; God promiſes to be their God, and they promiſe to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This Covenant was ſealed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by the <hi>Jews</hi> in Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover; and to Chriſtians, and by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, as ye have already heard: this is part of Gods worſhip, and will be to the end of the World; but this is not properly called a Vow, neither comes in the definition; there are ſome legal Vows, and thoſe are ſuch as of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> Numb. 16.2. as alſo thoſe of vowing Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and oblations, theſe were part of Gods worſhip in the time of the Law, but are not now; and there are Vows for ſome bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, as for Faſting, forbearance of Wine, or ſtrong Drink. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are not part of Gods Worſhip, but only helps to it: thus the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> drinking Wine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.6. Vows of things that are arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that may, or may not be done, and are left to Mans choice, thoſe are properly Vows, and not ſuch which are commanded,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40419:135"/> theſe are Duties before they are vowed, nor of things forbidden, theſe remain ſin after the Vow: now a Vow is either abſolute, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, when a mercy is given in, and we Vow ſome thing by way of thankfulneſs; conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, when we promiſe if God would give us ſuch a bleſſing, then we will do thus and thus; thus <hi>Jacob</hi> vowed, that if God would proſper his Journey, and give him bread to eat, and raiment to put on, then he ſhould be his God, and that ſtone ſhould be Gods houſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. the like did <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11. ſome alſo are temporal, binding for a time, and ſome perpetual binding for ever: now that you may vow and not ſin, take theſe following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>

                     </label> If thou wilt make a Vow, then thou muſt make it unto God, and to God alone; for there is no Scripture warrant to make it to any other, thou haſt many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and many approved examples, of making Vows to God, but none at all to any other Creature, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 76.11. <hi>Vow and pay unto the Lord our God,</hi> but where readeſt thou, make Vows and fulfil them to this Saint, or that Angel? for Vows are of the Nature of promiſſory, or the oath, but we may not ſwear by Creatures, but by God alone, as I have already proved; I know this contradicts the practice of Papiſts, but why do they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Scripture by their pactice? they Vow to this Saint, and that Angel; one Vows ſo much Oyl, another ſo many Candles, another
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40419:135"/> this, another that, but who requires theſe things at their hands? where have they their Warrant? what promiſe have they to ground their faith upon? when we read of Vows in Scripture, we read they were made to God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.2,3. <hi>if a man Vow a Vow, a Vow to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if a Woman Vow a Vow to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.21,22,23. <hi>when thou ſhalt Vow a Vow unto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not ſlack to pay it,</hi> Iſa. 19.21. when <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> vowed a Vow, it was neither to Saint or Angel, but to God alone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20.21. and why ſhould we not follow ſuch approved examples: but follow the Dictates of our own Brain? ſome Vows are conditional, if thou wilt give me this and this, then will I do thus and thus, this was <hi>Jacobs</hi> in the place before recited: if thou wilt give me Food and Raiment, thou ſhalt be my God, and this Stone ſhall be thy Houſe; thus was <hi>Hannahs,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11. <hi>if thou wilt give me a Son, then will I give him unto thee,</hi> now this can be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to none but to God alone, becauſe he alone can performe the condition: O their vows are of thankfulneſs for mercies received, thus <hi>David</hi> frequently Vows, Praiſes and Thanks, and to whom ſhould this be made, but unto him <hi>from whom every good and perfect gift comes,</hi> Jam. 1.17. who deſerves the praiſe, but he that grants the Mercy? we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks, for I know the Papiſts tell us, we may as properly Vow to Saints, as unto God: with this diſtinction to God, we Vow thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40419:136"/> for mercies received, to the Saints as our Mediators, for whoſe ſake we did receive them: but the Scripture acKnowledges but one Mediator, between God and Man, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and how came they to the knowledge of any other? we know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath told us, that every good and perfect gift comes from him; but we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, whether we receive any benefit by the interceſſion of Saints or Angels: We have commands to make Vows to God, but not to them, and if there had been ſuch an honor due to Saints departed, the Scriptures doubtleſs would not have been altogether ſilent; nay, we read the heavy judgments the Lord threateneth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.25.26. to them that made Vows, and would fulfill them unto the <hi>Queen of Heaven,</hi> and let them take heed of ſuch a reward: we deny it, and they muſt prove it by Scripture, where ſuch liberty is granted to pray to them, as if we had, which will never be proved: yet is there a difference between the one and the other, Vows are a more ſtrict and binding act of Religion, than Prayer is, for in a Vow there is prayer and ſomething more, prayer to God for his grace to perform the Vow, and alſo a purpoſe and promiſe of performance; we may put up Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to mortal Men, but not make Vows to them; yea, the matter of a Vow is ſometime ſuch, as is due to God alone, as when obedience, or ſuch like are promiſed; 'tis from God alone we may expect the mercy we want, 'tis from
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40419:136"/> him alone we receive what we have, 'tis he onely knows the heart, whether we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere or no; and he only can bring us to an account, or reward or puniſh us as we deſerve, and therefore unto him alone Vows are to be made and paid.</p>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40419:137"/> vow is obligatory, or becomes obliging, ſome come to their diſcretion ſooner, and ſome later, and ſome as I ſaid not at all: The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> held the vow of a man child was not valid till twelve years of age: and the maids at eleven, but this ſeems young enough; there is many that have lived many more years before they are fit to vow, for till they know the Nature, End, and uſe of a vow; how ſhould they perform ſuch a duty, faith alſo is neceſſary in this caſe, for, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. other graces of the ſpirit alſo are required, yea, a gratious temper and diſpoſition, for thoſe that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God; and they ſhould have grace, not only in the habit, but alſo in the act, or they will receive little benefit, by this duty: again the Party ſhould be <hi>ſui juris,</hi> his own man, and not under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers command; he muſt be at his own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as touching the thing he vows, or elſe his vow is unlawful, we read <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.4,5, &amp;c. <hi>that if a woman</hi> in her youth, that is paſt a child, vows a vow in her Fathers houſe, if her Father approved of her vow, it was rati, fied, if not, it was well, the like we read of a-married Woman, whoſe vow was ratified or nullified by her husband; and the like party of reaſon, ſhews that a Son, or Servant, or Subject, ought not to vow againſt the minde of Parents, Maſter or Prince, concerning things wherein they are ſubjected to them; can
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40419:137"/> a Son vow to leave his Parents? or a Servant his Maſters ſervice, during his engagement without their leave? to go on Pilgimage, or to live Monaſtical lives; the Law of Nature and Equity make ſuch vows ſinful, when 'tis to the wrong of the Superiours; the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in this caſe puts himſelf upon a neceſſity of ſinning, by ſuch a vow; if he keeps it, he breaks the law of God, which commands o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Superiour, whom they diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: if they break it, they ſin alſo againſt God, who tells us 'tis better not to vow, than to vow and not perform: ſome of the Papiſts themſelves (who give the largeſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in this caſe; I conceive more than ever God gives,) acknowledge that a wiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her husbands conſent, ought not to enter into a Nunnery, or vow a Monaſtick life; and the like parity of reaſon, holds for other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, in the things wherein they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: again, this is a free will offering, and no abſolue commands lye upon us, neither do we ſin if we vow not, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.22. <hi>if thou forbear to vow, it ſhall be no ſin in the,</hi> therefore none ſhould be conſtrained, or compelled to it; it ſhould be voluntary, at every ones own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; there is none ſhould be brought to it by force or fraud, by fear or violence, it ſhould be voluntary out of faith, and conſcience, in way of thankfulneſs, for mercies received; and for the obteining thoſe we want, by which we bind our ſelves to ſome neceſſary duty, for good ends, ſo long as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible

                     </label> If thou wouldeſt not offend in thy vows, take heed thou vow not any thing that is unlawful, or unneceſſary, or unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: if thou vow any thing repugnant to the word, or will of God, it cannot be acceptable to God; nay, whether thou performeſt or no, thou art a tranſgreſſor; there are ſome vows which bind unto commanded duties, as to dedicate our ſelves wholly unto God, and to obey him, that our vow in Baptiſm, which we often iterate in the other Sacraments, theſe vows are abſolute, and without condition; ſome are conditional, as the vows of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> before mentioned: if God give in the mercy, then are we obliged to make good our words, as they did, and alſo <hi>Jepth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah;</hi> but in all, whether abſolute or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, beware of vowing any unlawful thing: we are commanded to abſtain from evil, yea, from the very appearance of it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. if in our vows we dedicate any thing to God, let it be ſuch as he approves of: he likes not the hault, the blind, nor the lame in Sacrifice; <hi>Lev.</hi> 22.23. neither will he be ſerved <hi>with the hire of a whore, nor the price of a dog,</hi> Deut. 23.18. thou muſt vow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40419:138"/> that is thy own, and lawfully got. Thou muſt not vow any thing ſinful in it ſelf, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by circumſtance, or neceſſary accident: we ſee the Vows of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Perſecutors, that they would neither eat, nor drink till they had killed him, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.12. was ſinful in a double reſpect: Firſt, as it was a breach of God's Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> and alſo in that they Vowed a thing not in their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo that they were forc'd to break it: Our Vows alſo ſhould be Conſiderate, and not raſh, nor heady, as was that of <hi>Jephthah,</hi> which put him upon that unpleaſing Work, of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing his Daughter, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.30,34. And that of <hi>Saul,</hi> in binding his People from taſting Food, which had like to have coſt <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Life, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.25. Neither can thoſe Vows be juſtified of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> wherein they bind themſelves, and take the Sacrament upon it, to Murther Heretick Kings, as they call the Proteſtants, and to Maſſacree Proteſtants themſelves: But by what warrant is it done, and who gave them this Authority? A Vow ſhould not be <hi>vinculum Iniquitatis,</hi> a bond of Iniquity: Theſe had no better Excuſe than <hi>Herod</hi> had for Murdering <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> nay, not ſo good: They Vow it intentionally, he did not; they perform willingly, he with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy. Neither ſhould Vows be to do things Superſtitious, as that of the Papiſts Pilgrimages, to the Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> and ſuch like. Nay, 'tis not every Lawful thing that ſhould be the Matter of a Vow, but
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40419:139"/> ſomething that is weighty and conſiderable, and tends to ſome good End; 'tis Lawful to take up this ſtick, or that ſtraw, to pare the Nails, or clip the Hair; but theſe things are not fit Matter for a vow, 'tis but a taking God's Name in vain, and the abuſing of the Ordinance, to uſe it upon ſuch trivial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. Neither ſhould it be of ſuch things, which muſt be done whether they will or no; as for a Man to vow that he will dye, or come to Judgment; but it ſhould be of ſome neceſſary thing, agreeable to the Scripture, to Dedicate our ſelves to God, to Obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as in Baptiſmal vows, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Of Thankfulneſs to God for Mercies Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 22.25. <hi>My Praiſe ſhall be of thee in the great Congregation, I will pay my Vows before them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 66.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or for other things, as <hi>David</hi> vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give himſelf no reſt, till he had found out a place for God's Houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.2, <hi>&amp;c. Numh.</hi> 6.2. As <hi>Hannah,</hi> for a Son, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to give him to God; for vows either bind us unto ſin, and theſe are unlawful, or unto Moral Obedience, which is Lawful, or unto Ceremonial Obedience, which was Lawful, but now is not, or unto ſomething which is an help to Obedience; as Faſting, which is an help to Prayer; abſtaining from Wine, and ſtrong Drink, which is an help to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Fleſh, to Alms-deeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or ſome indifferent thing; as <hi>Paul</hi> binds himſelf by a vow not to cheriſh his Hair for a time, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40419:139"/> from eating of Fleſh, in Caſe of Offence, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. The <hi>Rechabites</hi> abſtaining from Wine, and Strong Drink, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.6. And ſo we ought to do, if we find our Nature inclined to Intemperance, in the uſe of theſe Creatures. Now, theſe are moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Matters for vows, which are not Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Duties, nor forbidden Sins, but will be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us in thoſe Duties that are Commanded.</p>

                     </label> As the Matter of a Vow muſt be Lawful, ſo alſo it muſt be poſſible, and in a Man's own power to perform; and it ſhould be in a Man's Choice whether he Vow or no, and before the Vow whether he do the thing or no; for if it be a Commanded Duty, he is bound to it whether he Vow or no; but if he Vow he hath a double engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, and a double ſin if he neglect; <hi>for 'tis better not to Vow, than to Vow and not perform,</hi> Eccl. 5.5. But a Vow properly ſhould be a thing at a Man's own Choice, and alſo in his own Power; but what a Man is bound to before as his Duty, is not in his Choice; 'tis his Duty though he had not Vowed: As to Obey the Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet to quicken and ſtir up our ſelves to Obedience, 'tis Lawful, and I conceive many times neceſſary, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to renew our Covenants, and bind our ſelves to that which God in his Word hath bound us to, and made our Duty; as the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant is oft renewed in the other Sacrament: Yet had it been our Duty to have
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40419:140"/> Devoted our ſelves to God's Service, had we never Covenanted to do it; and ſo in other particular Duties. Now, in ſo doing, we make not our ſelves more Duties than we had before, but ſtir up our ſelves better to perform them; as if we vow a ſtricter watch over our Hearts, a more conſtant courſe of Family Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, a more conſtant attendance upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and tye our ſelves to a ſet time for Meditation, ſelf-Examination, and ſuch like Duties; <hi>David</hi> frequenty vows the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fotmance of that, which were his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Duties: As of Sacrifice, Thankſgiving, and the like. Now, concerning things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which we may either do, or forbear; 'tis good before hand to conſider our Ability to perform them, and not after the vow to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; <hi>God hath no pleaſure in the Sacrifice of Fools,</hi> Eccl. 5.4. As the Matter muſt not be ſinful, ſo neither impoſſible, or out of our Power to perform; as their vow was, both, that vowed never to eat Bread, till they had killed <hi>Paul:</hi> Neither ſhould it intrench upon our Chriſtian Liberty; lay not a ſtumbling-block before thine own Feet: Make not that Sin which God hath not made Sin, except it be for a greater good, and an apparent help in Heavens way; as when a Man vows Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that knows not whether he have the Gift of Continency, and ſo lays a ſnare for his own Feet, and, perhaps, brings himſelf into a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Sinning: 'Tis a ſad thing, that a Man ſhould renounce Marriage, and vow a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40419:140"/> Single Life, when he knows not whether he hath Power to contian: To remain Single is no ſin; nay in ſome Caſes, a Benefit, where this gift is given: But to vow it, is to vow a thing that is not in their Power; God hath aſſured no Man that he will give him this gift, and if he do not give it, it is not to be had; he requires no more than he gives; he that will not put New Wine into Old Bottles, nor ſuffer his Diſciples to Faſt, till they were able; will not require this at their hands, which he knows they cannot bear. Chriſt himſelf tells us, <hi>'Tis a ſaying, all Men cannot bear,</hi> Mat. 19.11. And the Apoſtle tells us, all Men have not this Gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7. And this hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Snare to many, who can neither Marry, nor contain; but the Apoſtle tells us, 'tis better Marry than burn, and God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Marriage for thoſe that cannot contain: And why then ſhould any put a Bolt upon this door againſt themſelves? And for the reſt of Monaſtical vows, as they had their riſe either from Infidels, or were grounded in Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo are they beſides; yea, contrary to the Law of God: For herein Men Worſhip God after their own Inventions, and Teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men; and when they look for a Reward, God will ask them, who required theſe things at their Hands. They vow Poverty, that they may Live at eaſe; and in plenty, by the Sweat of other Mens brows: This takes Men from a Lawful Calling, which they ſhould follow,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40419:141"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Let every Man abide in the Calling wherein he was Called:</hi> And from their Honeſt Labour, which is Commanded, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>If a Man will not Labour, let him not Eat:</hi> It makes them neglect their Duties to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, in providing for their Families, a Commanded Duty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides not for his Family, hath denyed the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> Their Regular Obedience makes them ſlight the Laws of God, to follow the dictates of Man; yea, makes God's Laws of no Effect. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.8. It makes them do all in way of Merit, which the Scripture denies, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. <hi>When you have done all that is Commanded, ſay yc are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants,</hi> Rom. 6.23. <hi>The Wages of ſin is Death, but the Gift of God is Eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 4.6. &amp; 8.18. &amp; 9.16. 2 Cor. 4.17. Where we ſee, all we enjoy is of free Grace, &amp; and no room left for mans Merits: Such vows as theſe therefore have no footing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore are not for our imitation.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldſt by thy vows Glorifie God, or benefit thine own Soul, thou muſt look at the manner as well as the matter, for this alſo is to be regarded; many a Duty materially good is ſpoyled by the ill perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, as we ſee in Sacrifices and Oblations, and in the Obſervation of the New Moons, and Solemn Aſſemblies, all appointed, and Commanded Duties, ſo ſpoyled in the doing, that God would not own them; yea, his Soul did abominate them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40419:141"/> 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as if he ſlew a Man; and he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he Cut off a Dogs Neck; he that Offereth an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as if he Offered Swines Blood; he that burneth Incenſe, as if he Bleſſed and Idol,</hi> &amp;c. We ſee Commanded Duties may be grievous Sins, when ill performed. Now, a vow, as well as an Oath (for a vow is a Promiſſory Oath to God) ſhould be made in Truth, in Judgment, and in Righteouſneſs. In Truth and ſo it ſhould be made with a ſincere Heart, without fraud, deceit, aequivocation, or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: For as God requires the Heart in all Service, ſo likewiſe in this. A Promiſe made to him with Guile, and Hypocriſie, is but a mocking of him, that will not be mocked. 'Tis like <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the price of their Land to God, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards keeping back part of the price to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by this loſt themſelves. A nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Example we have of a ſerious vow worthy our Imitation; we may read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.14,15. where we find <hi>Judahs</hi> entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, 'tis ſaid, <hi>they ſware unto the Lord with Trumpets, and ſhouting, and with the Cornet, and all</hi> Judah <hi>rejoyced at the Oath, for they had ſworn with all their Hearts, and ſought him with all their deſires,</hi> &amp;c. And how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable this was to God, we may find in the following words; <hi>he was found of them, and the Lord gave them reſt round about.</hi> But take heed of being like thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God, <hi>But it was feignedly, ſaith the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40419:142"/> Lord:</hi> But 'tis better not to Vow, than to Vow, and not perform; for God will avenge the Quarrel of his Covenant. And as a Vow ſhould be in Truth, ſo it ſhould be voluntary, not by conſtraint; for it ſhould be with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, and therefore 'tis called a free-will Offering, and God expects it ſhould chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be performed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.23. <hi>That which is gone out of thy Lips, thou ſhalt keep, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Free will Offering, according to what thou haſt Vowed unto the Lord, which thou haſt promiſed with thy Mouth.</hi> Though God do not Command thee to Vow, as in the Verſe before; <hi>If thou ſhalt forbear to Vow it ſhall be no ſin in thee;</hi> yet when thou haſt engaged thy Soul, he expects the performance; for as a Vow is free, ſo ſhould the performance of it alſo. This ſhews, when Young Perſons are put into Monaſteries, Nunneries, or Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as they are called, and forc'd there to take the required Oaths, of Single Life, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that againſt their wills; 'tis not of Gods Deviſing, but of the Devils Invention: And likewiſe when Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, againſt their Parents wills, are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or allured to take ſuch Oaths, and Vows, and ſo alienate themſelves from their Parents Obedience; this is no pleaſing Service to him: See his mind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.5,6. Parents muſt not be wronged upon Religious Accounts. And as Vows ſhould be in Truth, ſo likewiſe in Judgment; blind Sacrifices were never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God: Men ſhould well underſtand
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40419:142"/> what they do, and know the nature of a Vow, and the Lawfulneſs of the thing Vowed, and the profitableneſs thereof, and how it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to their main deſign, before they engage. There are ſome things God will not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to him, as <hi>the price of a Dog, or the Hire of a Whore,</hi> Deut. 23.18. Thoſe that Vow alſo ſhould know their ability to perform, and not make them, and be forc'd to break them, for, <hi>ultra poſſe non eſt eſſe,</hi> God delights not in the words of ſuch Fools, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.5. A vow ſhould tend alſo for ſome Profit, for Body or Soul, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s did; but what profit is there in voluntary Poverty, Pilgrimages, in vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl, Candles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Saints departed, no man was ever yet able to find out. It ſhould be made in Righteouſneſs alſo, and ſhould be at their own diſpoſe, as before was ſaid, to vow that Service to one, which is due to another is a point of injuſtice, and no Law of God requires it: It muſt be of fit things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; we muſt not Serve God with what is not, our own, it muſt, in a word, be in that which may conduce to God's Glory, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of our great deſign; or otherwiſe 'tis either ſinful, or fooliſh.</p>

Though Vows are not ſtrictly any part of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet are they helps and furtherances in it, and therefore ſhould be carefully made, and faithfully performed: We read, I know, of Believers, that have made Vows unto God for the performing of Spiritual Duties, which they muſt not have neglected, though they had not vowed it; but this makes it not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but a help to Worſhip; and if they are of things indifferent, yet are they not part of God's Worſhip, but that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to the better performance of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I know the Papiſts they ſay, they are part of his Worſhip, though they are made of things not Commanded; as Meats, Drinks, Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and tend to perfection; and by the keeping of them, a man may attain to a higher perfection, than in the Obſervation of Commanded Duties; but what Scripture ſaith thus? Their End, which is to Merit by

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40419:144"/> Sin, ought not to do it. If thou Sin in thy Vow, do not ratifie it by performing it, as <hi>Herod,</hi> who made a raſh Vow, but did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his guilt by Cutting off <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Head. But ſuppoſing thy vow be Lawful, thou canſt not Lawfully break it; nay, though the performance tend to thy damage, for if thou do, thou committeſt a Sin as bad, if not worſe than Perjury; <hi>When thou haſt Vowed, therefore deferr not to pay, for God takes no pleaſure in Fools, pay that therefore which thou haſt Vowed,</hi> Eccl. 5.3,4,5,6. Deut. 23.23. <hi>When thou haſt Vowed a Vow unto the Lord thy God, deferr not to pay it, for the Lord thy God will ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of thee, and it will be ſin to thee; but if thou wilt forbear to Vow, it ſhall not be ſin to thee; that which is gone out of thy Mouth thou ſhalt keep and perform a Free-will Offering according to what thou haſt vowed unto the Lord thy God, which thou haſt promiſed with thy Mouth,</hi> Pſal. 76.11. <hi>Vow and pay unto the Lord your God,</hi> &amp;c. More places might be inſtanced in, if theſe were not ſufficient. If thy vow be raſh Repent of the raſhneſs of it, but if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Lawful, it muſt be performed, if it prove to thy damage, it is a reward of thy Folly. But if it be unlawful, repent of thy ſin, and Folly in making it, but it muſt not be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for a Vow muſt not be a bond of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: Chriſt himſelf ſhews the wickedneſs of ſuch a vow, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.5,6. where by their vow <hi>Corban,</hi> they made null the Command of God, concerning honouring Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40419:145"/> and Relieving them. It is not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to Dedicate thoſe things to Pious Uſes; yea, to God himſelf, which we owe to anotner; <hi>David</hi>'s raſh vow, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5.12.39. was not performed; he vowed the Deſtruction of <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his Family, and Bleſſed God for keeping him from doing evil. The wicked vow of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Perſecutors ought not to have been fulfilled, had the power lain in their Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.21. Nor the raſh and unadviſed Vow of <hi>Saul,</hi> which tended to hurt and not to good, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.39. Nor ſuch Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious vows, as we read of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.25. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, ye and your Wives have both ſpoken with your Mouths, and fulfilled with your Hands, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we will ſurely perform our Vows, that we have Vowed, to burn Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven, and to powre out Drink-Offerings unto her, ye will ſurely accompliſh your Vows,</hi> &amp;c. God takes it ill in them, and ſorely threatneth them for it. But if the Vow be Lawful, he expects the fulfilling of it; as we ſee in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Vow, made <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. God minds him of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.13. I am the God of <hi>Bethel,</hi> where thou anointedſt the Pillar, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.3, &amp;c. A Young womans vow, if her Father contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it not, ſhall ſurely ſtand good. See alſo <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.16. &amp; 22.17. &amp; 27.2, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 76.12. Yea, the Lord threatens thoſe that make not good their vows, that vow a better, and pay a worſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Curſed be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, which hath in his Flock a Male, and

                  <p>THE next Duty I ſhall Direct you in, is that Uſeful, though much neglected Duty of Faſting, which, though in it ſelf is no part of Divine worſhip, neither is it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for it ſelf; yet when 'tis performed in a right manner, and to a right End, is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table help in other Religious Duties, and a good Spur to put us forward to worſhip God, and fits us for his worſhip. Now, before I ſhew you what a Faſt is, I ſhall ſhew you what Faſt I mean, for there are Faſts of ſeveral ſorts; and 'tis not the bare abſtinence from Meat, that is ſufficient: There are ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Faſts, when men Faſt whether they will or no; as when they have nothing to eat, and this is too oft the Poor mans, and the Priſoners Faſt; but this is againſt their wills, and ſo not thanks-worthy. Again, there is a Natural Faſt, when a man abſtains from Food for want of a Stomack, as the other did for want of Meat, and this is the Sick mans Faſt; and oft-times the Rich man Faſts alſo, this alſo is in-voluntary, and deſerves no praiſe. There is alſo a Phyſical Faſt undertaken for Healths ſake, this is not it we Treat of; and there is a daily Faſt, when Men uſe the Creatures
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40419:146"/> very temperately, and moderately; not to pleaſe, or ſatisfie their Appetite; but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Life and ſtrength, to do God ſervice; they eat to live, and not live to eat; and live to ſerve and praiſe God; and this ſhould be every Chriſtians Faſt. There is alſo a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Faſt, ſuch as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſe; an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from certain meats, upon Religious Accounts, when in the mean time they fully gorge themſelves with other meats every way as nouriſhing, and provoking to Luſt, and this upon the Account of Merit: And there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Civil Faſt, when upon Politick Accounts, ſome ſorts of meats are forbidden at ſome times; as with us Fleſh in the Lent, for the encouragement of our Trade of Fiſhing, and for the preſervation of Cattle: There are ſome Miraculous Faſts; as that of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, all which Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forty days together, and taſted no Food; but theſe are for our Admiration, not for our Imitation. There is alſo a Spiritual Faſt, an abſtinence from Sin, which all ſhould Imitate; and there is a Hypocritical Faſt, ſuch as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> uſed, to be ſeen of Men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2, <hi>&amp;c. Theſe hang down the Head like a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſh,</hi> Iſa. 58.5. And there is a Diabolical Faſt, wherein the Devils Service is promoted; <hi>A Faſt for strife and debate, and to ſtrike with the Fiſts of Wickedneſs,</hi> Iſa. 58.4. Such a Faſt <hi>Jezebel</hi> Proclaimed, when under pretence of Religious Worſhip, ſhe took away <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boath</hi>'s Life for his Vineyard, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.8,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40419:147"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is of the Devils Invention: But there is a Religious Faſt ſet apart upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Account, for a man to Afflict his Soul, and this is that we now ſpeak to, which is the Sanctifying, or ſetting apart a day, or ſome portion of time, to the Lord, upon ſome extraordinary Occaſion, by the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary abſtinence from meat, and drink, and other Comforts of this Life; as alſo from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Worldly buſineſs, ſo far as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Comelineſs, and Neceſſity will permit, for the more ſerious humbling of the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and pouring out our requeſts to him for the preventing, or removing of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments felt, or feared; or the begging the Mercies we want, or the continuance of thoſe we enjoy. That ſuch a kind of Faſt is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the Scripture is evident; it was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.27,28. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.5. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.16,17. &amp; 9.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. And ſuch a Faſt was Obſerved, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2,3,4, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.23. We have the Examples of the beſt men; yea, of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in ſo doing. Nay, <hi>Jews, Turks, Papists, Protestants,</hi> &amp;c. all agree in this; that it is a Duty, though they differ in the manner, and Ends of the Duty: Yet muſt we not look upon it as any part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip, or deſirable for it's own ſake, for 'tis a thing indifferent in it ſelf, and 'tis to be uſed ſo far forth as it conduceth to the main deſign of God's Honour, and the good of the Soul, and ſerves to the Ends propounded in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40419:147"/> the Scriptures, which is the humbling of the Soul, and making us more ſenſible of our wants, and more fervent in our Prayers. And Experience ſhews when it hath been joyned with fervent Prayer, very great things have been wrought by it, great Deliverances have been got, great Mercies procured, and great Judgments diverted. Now, this Religious Faſt is either Publique, or Private: Publique when Commanded by Publique Authority, and generally Obſerved; as <hi>Joel</hi> 1.19. <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.7. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.13. And Private, when 'tis performed by a Perſon, or Family, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.6. And of this Faſt Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.17,18.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40419:148"/> the Children, and thoſe that ſuck the Breaſts: Let the Bridegroom go forth out of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet,</hi> &amp;c. nay, the very Beaſts of the field are not exempted, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.7,8. <hi>Let nither man or beaſt, heard or flock, taſte any thing, let them not feed or drink water, but let man and beast be covered with ſack cloath: and cry mightily unto God, yea, let them turn every one from his evil ways, and from the violence that is in his hands, who can tell if God will turn or repent,</hi> &amp;c. In this faſt, the Miniſter moſt commonly, is their mouth to God, and Gods mouth to them; yet they have need of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for the duty, for though he perform much of the external part of the duty, yet, the internal reſts upon them: thy heart ſhould be qualified to put up an acceptable prayer to God, great ones are not excepted from this duty, for their ſins are great, yea, perhaps greater, and admit of greater aggravations than others do, and their examples much, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; Infants you ſee though uncapable, were not freed, even ſuch as hang upon their Mothers breaſt, and though they had not actually ſinned, yet were a part of that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lump of mankind, and deſerved judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as others: and therefore ſhould be timely traind up in this Chriſtian duty, and their cries for meat, and the very bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Beaſts might ſtick ſomething upon the heart of man, and help further to humble and break it; yea, many of thoſe little ones, being Gods Elect, their preſence may be an
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40419:148"/> arguing with God, to ſpare, as the preſence of <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> moved <hi>Elijah</hi> to come to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.19. this was one Motive why the Lord would not deſtroy <hi>Niniveh,</hi> becauſe there were ſixſcore thouſand ſouls in it, that knew not the right hand from the left. But though all theſe come, and 'tis their duty to come, yet all come not rightly prepared and qualified for that work; if thou wouldeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtand in the Gap, and turn away the wrath of God from the Land: thou ſhouldeſt be one in Covenant with God, and one that hath the work of grace upon thy Soul; one that hath a friend in Court, an intereſt in Chriſt the Mediator, and canſt through him go boldly to the Throne of grace; one that can without lying, call God Father, and lay claim to the ſhare in his promiſes, one that art reconciled to God, through the blood of his Son; ſuch a one is like to prevail for mercy, 'tis not thoſe that howl for Corne and Wine he regards, 'tis not the crying of the Swine, or the bellowing of Beaſts he matters, if there be a full Congregation of unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sinners, that reſolve to love, and not leave their ſins: I queſtion whether theſe mens cryes, do not prevail more to bring down judgments, than mercies; when men cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>od, and promiſe obedience and never intend to perform it; this is but a mocking of God, that will not be mocked; and the breaking of the Covenant with him, that can and will avenge the quarrel of his
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40419:149"/> Covenant; we cannot deceive him, though we come with Tears in our Eyes: If there be not ſorrow in the Heart, our <hi>Crocodile</hi> Tears will not Advantage us: But if there be but weak gifts and parts, if the Heart be right, yet they will be owned; God looks not ſo much at the out-ſide as the inſide of Duty. Though I know thoſe that carry on the work, eſpecially in Publique, ſhould be men of parts and Abilities (and 'tis well if all were thus Qualified) 'tis a ſweet Conjunction, where Grace and parts meet) they ſhould know their own Sins, and the Sins of the Nation to bewail and confeſs them, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.4.6. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.6,7. They ſhould know their own wants, and the wants of the Nation, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.11.18. In a word, every Novice in Religion is not fit for ſo high a Duty, and therefore Chriſt himſelf Excuſeth his Diſciples for not Faſting, not onely becauſe the Bride-groom was with them, but, as 'tis conceived, becauſe they were not yet fit for ſo high a duty, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.36,37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15,16.</p>

Now, the preparation requiſite, is partly External, and partly Internal; the External helps forward the other, and they are ſuch as theſe. On the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40419:149"/> Evening before lay aſide thy Bodily Labour betimes, that thou mayſt trim up thy Lamp to meet the Bride groom the day following; and prepare thy Heart againſt the next days duties, and take that Evening but a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Supper, ſuch as will help, and not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee in the enſuing duty; and continue as long as thou canſt without prejudice to thy Health, or hinderance to thy duties of the day following; for thou ſhouldſt deny thy ſelf in ſleep as well as in other Comforts of this Life; but all this ſhould be but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the main work, and ſo no further to be uſed than it is helpful to it. Now, the main work is to get the Heart into a melting frame, and humble temper; for what good will it do us, to come and go with the Heart unbroken? Now, that it may be ſo, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thy ſins, and the ſins of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the ſeveral aggravations of them, will be of great uſe, when they are preſt home upon the Spirit by ſerious Meditations: Call to mind therefore thy Original Guilt, and the pollution of thy Nature, and how the whole Man, Soul and Body is defiled by it, and thy beſt Duties ſtained; as alſo thy Actual Sins, many for Number, and hainous for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Call to mind the Sins of thy Youth, and of thy riper Age; the Sins of thy Calling, general and particular; thy Relation Sins, and how thou haſt failed in every Relation thou haſt been in: Thy Sins of Omiſſion, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Participation; thy Sins of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

Nor to beg for one Mercy, that thou art not reſolved to Labour for, as well as to Pray for; <hi>For if thou regardeſt Iniquity in thy Heart, God will not hear thy Prayer,</hi> Pſal. 66.18. Shouldeſt thou come with a reſolution to Live in ſin, and pray for the Pardon of it, thou doſt but mock God, that will not mocked, and takeſt his Name
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40419:150"/> in vain; when thou ſayeſt, Lord, when wilt thou give me this Mercy? God may ſay, Man, when wilt thou leave thy Sin? When wilt thou give me thy Heart? If thou ſay never, God will return thee the like Anſwer. Never think by thy Prayers to benefit thy ſelf, or the Church, if thou wilt not reform thine own Heart. And as thou muſt conſider thy ſins, ſo alſo thy wants; what Mercies thou wouldeſt beg for thy ſelf, or others; ſhould a King promiſe at ſuch a day to meet his Subjects, and ſupply their wants, how careful would they be, not only to come, but alſo to conſider what Petitions to put up, and what Favours to beg; 'tis no doubt but while we are in theſe Houſes of Clay, we have a <hi>back bias</hi> of Corruption, drawing us out of the way, and ſo many are our wants. Some Souls are made up all of wants, they have no Grace, let them beg, and pray, and endeavour that ſome may be beſtowed, and to have their Hearts Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and their Natures changed. The beſt of God's People have defects in Grace, and theſe they ſhould Labour to have removed, and their wants ſupplyed. Some have decays in Grace, and this is the time for their recovery; in a word, many things we have to beg for our ſelves, many for our Friends; many for the Nation, and many for the Church in general; many Judgments are threatned, which we would have diverted, and many felt, we would have removed; know then before hand, what Errant thou art come about.</p>

                     </label> Concerning our External Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the days of Humiliation, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething, for having made the preparation before mentioned, and the day being come, there are ſome External Duties required, <hi>viz.</hi> That we riſe betimes that morning, and deny our ſelves that reſt and ſleep, which our ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Nature requires, ſo far forth as we do not thereby diſ-able our ſelves for the duty, and that we ſpend the whole day in the work, and let us not think a whole day too much, for if we prevail not for the diverting thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which our ſins deſerve; perhaps, we may ſpend many Years in greater Sufferings: And 'tis thy duty alſo to bring as many of thy Family as conveniently may be along with thee, eſpecially thoſe that have Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Congregation may be full, that we may joyn together as one man, in the work; that may be done by many, that a few cannot do, I have obſerved upon ſuch occaſions; men think one in a Family ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to come to the Congregation, while the other mind their worldly Occaſions; but as theſe Sow ſparingly, ſo they are like to reap little. The King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> will riſe up in Judgment againſt thoſe, who Commanded all men and Beaſts to reſt and Faſt, and what lies in thee, come with an humble Heart, and a ſelf-denying Spirit to the work; and to this End Faſting is enjoyned, which of it ſelf is a thing indifferent, but of excellent uſe to bring the Body into Subjection. Now, this ſhould
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40419:151"/> be a total abſtinence from all meat and drink, except unfeigned neceſſity forbid; the very Name and Nature of a Faſt implies this much, and if this abſtinence be not obſerved, 'tis no Faſt. <hi>Eſther</hi> we find, Commands the <hi>Jews</hi> neither to eat nor drink for three days, and promiſes that ſhe and her Maids would do the like, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 4.16. Yet if this total abſtinence be really prejudicial to the Health, and prove a hinderance, and not a furtherance to the duty, 'tis Lawful to take ſome little refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for though Scripture Examples afford us not ſo much; yet rectified reaſon, yea, and Scripture grounds warrant it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. <hi>I have deſired Mercy and not Sacrifice;</hi> a place urged by Chriſt himſelf upon ſuch an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.7. And Faſting being Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an help, is no duty when it becomes an hinderance, but then it ſhould be but a ſmall reflection, ſo much, and no more, as will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive decayed Nature, prevent the danger, and fit a man for the duty. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their Faſts, or rather mock-faſts, obſerve not this rule; their Faſt conſiſts not in the abſtinence from, but in the choice of meats and drinks, for which we have no Scripture Evidence, nor indeed any ſhew of reaſon; they forbear fleſh, when they gorge themſelves with Wine, and ſtrong Drink, and Fiſh, and other Dainties, which no leſs pamper the Body, and provoke Luſt; but at this rate a Man may Faſt, not only forty days, but forty Years, with little Trouble: But a Scripture Faſt conſiſts not in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40419:152"/> the choice of Meat, but in the abſtinence from Meat, and Drink, not in the choice of Meat, for all is alike Lawful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25.27. &amp; 8.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8,9. And as Meat and Drink, ſo alſo Bodily Labour is forbidden; this muſt be laid aſide, as upon a Sabbath; for Worldly buſineſs divert the mind, and unfit it for Duty. We find upon thoſe days of Atonement, as they were called under the Law, work was forbidden upon pain of death, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.27, &amp;c. <hi>Whatſoever Soul it be, that doth any work upon that ſame day, the ſame Soul will I deſtroy from among his People.</hi> Alſo <hi>Num.</hi> 29.7. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.29. Now, though the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious part of this be taken away, yet ſo far as it conduceth to the main End, <hi>viz.</hi> to Afflict the Soul, it remains in Force: How can there be a Solemn Congregating together, or the work of the day be carried on, if there be not a ceſſation from Bodily Labour? Again, Coſtly and Gorgeous Apparel muſt be that day laid aſide, as unfit for ſuch a Duty; we find Kings themſelves upon ſuch days, Girded themſelves with Sack-cloath, and put Aſhes upon their Heads, and did not, as in our times, mourn in Scarlet, Silks, and Sattins, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.4,5,6. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.6. Muſick alſo, and other Sports and Recreations muſt be abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as very unſuitable for Mourning times. God complains of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they in their Faſts did find pleaſure; and may he not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of many of us, that as ſoon as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is over, fall to our Recreations, as
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40419:152"/> at other times, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. Yea, from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Duties, at other times Lawful, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the word of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud not one another, except it be with conſent for a time, that you may give your ſelves to Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer.</hi> Alſo <hi>Joel</hi> 2.16.

                     </label> Having Directed you in the External part of the Duty, it remains that I ſpeak ſomething of the Internal, which is the very Life and Soul of the Duty, without which all the reſt is but a dead Carkaſs, a bare Name of a Faſt. When thou comeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before God in this Duty, ſet thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with all reverence, as before an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Judge, juſtly provoked by thy Faults. Come with ſhame in thy Face, and ſorrow in thy Heart, and, if poſſible, with Tears in thy Eyes, and make a full and free Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thy Faults, with all the aggravating Circumſtances thereof; and reſt not till thy Heart bleed for thy Sins: Shouldeſt thou rip, and confeſs all the ſins that ever thou hadſt Committed, with all the aggravations, with which they are cloathed, if thy Heart were not touch'd with ſorrow for them, it would be but a further aggravation of them, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40419:153"/> provoke the Lord to Anger, and not to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. If thy Faſt be private, confeſs all the evil thou knoweſt by thy ſelf, till thou canſt ſay with a good Conſcience, I have kept nothing back. Now, this preſſing Sin upon thy Soul is called a renting of the Heart, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rent your Hearts, and not your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> An Afflicting of the Soul, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.29. <hi>In it you ſhall Afflict your ſouls, and do no work at all,</hi> Lev. 23.29. <hi>Whatſoever Soul ſhall not be Afflicted in that ſame day he ſhall be cut off from among his People.</hi> Conſider the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy Heart, thy Natural Corruptions; conſider the Number of thy by-paſt ſins, and the weight of thy preſent remaining Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the wrath of God is kindled againſt thee for them, and the danger thy Soul is in of Hell, by reaſon of them. Conſider ſin in it's own Nature is the worſt of Evils, and the cauſe of all other Evils, 'tis the fouleſt thing in the World; yea, fouler than the Devil himſelf, for that made him foul; and could he be ſtript of his ſin, he would return to his Angelical Glory. Conſider it in the Cauſes, it had it's Original from the Devil himſelf; he was the firſt Sinner, and the cauſe of ſin in Men; and the Child very much reſembles the Father. Conſider the Law of God, of which ſin is a tranſgreſſion; 'tis Holy, Juſt, and Good, and no reaſon can be given why it ſhould not be Obeyed. Conſider the Perſon againſt whom thou ſinneſt, and it is againſt God himſelf, who is the chiefeſt Good; yea,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40419:153"/> the Fountain of all thy Mercies; One to whom thou oweſt thy ſelf, and all thou haſt; he that is thy Creator, and made thee; 'tis he that maintaineth thee at his own Coſt and Charges: One that is able to ſave thee, or deſtroy thee. Conſider it in the woful Effects of it, 'tis the Cauſe of all thy Judgments felt, or feared; yea, of Spiritual, Temporal, and Eternal Judgments: For the Wages of Sin is Death, but the Gift of God is Eternal Life. Conſider it in the price that was paid to free thy Soul from the Guilt, and filth of it, and that was the precious Blood of the Son of God, who loſt his Life to Ranſom Souls from the ſlavery of Satan, and his Blood to waſh away their ſcarlet ſins. The ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe things will much further thy Humiliation, and Soul-Affliction: And when thou haſt thus made thy Heart to bleed for thy ſins, go to God for a Plaiſter; but what good will a Plaiſter do before there is a Wound? Beg of him the Pardon of thy ſin; and not only ſo, but power againſt it: Renew thy Covenant with him of better Obedience, not only purpoſe, but promiſe amendment of Life; reſolve againſt ſin for the time to come: Every ſin thou confeſſeſt, let it be with a ſtrong reſolution to meddle no more with it. This is that Spiritual Faſt from ſin, which is every Chriſtians Duty; to Faſt from Food, and not from filthineſs; from pleaſure, and not from profaneſs; from ſleep, and not from ſin, is the Devils Faſt; ſuch Faſts he keeps, and ſuch
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40419:154"/> will be kept in Hell: But the contrary was <hi>David</hi>'s humbling of his Soul with Faſting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.10. In which there muſt be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin, an Accuſation for it, a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and alſo ſelf-condemnation. And though Prayer at all times ſhould be fervent, yet eſpecially now in ſuch a Duty; this is called a Crying mightily unto God, <hi>Joel</hi> 1.14. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.8. And thou ſhouldſt bring Faith along with thee, believing thou ſhalt prevail, which may be grounded upon the many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to this Duty, and the Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have in Scripture of the ſucceſs <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, Hezekiah, Eſther, Niniveh,</hi> and many other may witneſs; nay, where was it ever in Scripture faithfully performed without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs? Alms-deeds alſo ſhould be added, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.6,7. Yea, we ſhould teſtifie our Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation by our ready forgiving of others, and aſſiſting thoſe that ſtand in need. Beg alſo thoſe many things that are wanting, for thy ſelf, the Church, or State; and as in the Law, Sacrifices, and Offerings were given to God: Sacrifice thy ſin to him, and Offer to him the Calves of thy Lips, Prayer and praiſe; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate thy ſelf a Living Sacrifice, and devote thy ſelf to his Service.</p>

We hold that there are no ſuch
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40419:154"/> fixed times to be obſerved: But the Duty is incumbent on us as Occaſions are offered. 'Tis true, there is mention made of a day, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.29. but this was Ceremonial, and ended with the reſt of the Typs, and Shadows; and there is mention alſo made of the Faſt in <hi>the fifth and ſeventh Moneth,</hi> Zach. 7.5. And of the <hi>fourth, fifth, ſeventh, and tenth Moneth,</hi> Zach. 8.19. but this was during the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo juſt occaſion was offered for Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Humiliation: but what is this to our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs? We had the like every Moneth in times of War, and publick Calamity. And it is fit we ſhould have upon ſuch Occaſions: But what is this to our ſtated times, whether Occaſion be or no? When there is ſome great Judgment lying upon us, or ſome Eminent Danger hanging over our Heads, then 'tis a ſuitable time for this Exerciſe. We find in Scripture that there were Faſts kept by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in all Ages, upon emergent Occaſions; thus <hi>Samuel</hi> and the People Faſted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord in their danger, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6,7. And thus <hi>David</hi> beſought the Lord by Prayer, and Faſting, for the Life of his Child, when it was Sick, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16. And thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when a ſore Judgment from God was upon it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.16. The Inhabitants of <hi>Jabiſh Gilead</hi> Faſted, and humbled themſelves, when <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> were Slain, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> put to flight, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.15. And <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> in his Fear, Proclaims a Faſt, when he knew not what to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40419:155"/> do, yet had he his Eyes up to God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. And <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he heard of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> humbled himſelf by Faſting, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.4. And <hi>Eſther,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Writings were Signed, and the time was ſet, when they ſhould all have been deſtroyed, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ezra,</hi> when he apprehended danger at hand, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.21. Yea, this is the Courſe which the Lord himſelf Adviſeth to in times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Publick Calamity, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12,13. having threatned a ſore Judgment; he adds, <hi>Therefore now, ſaith the Lord, turn ye unto me with all your Hearts, and with Faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning, and rent your Hearts and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and Merciful,</hi> &amp;c. And this Courſe the <hi>Ninivites</hi> did take, and it ſucceeded, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5.8. Yea, <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf, when Judgment was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and it was deferred in his days, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27. Many more Inſtances might be given to prove times of Publique Calamity, ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable times for this Duty. When Sin alſo abounds, 'tis a time for God's People to be Mourners in <hi>Zion,</hi> for aſſuredly Judgments will follow, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9 4. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6,7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.10. <hi>David</hi> wept, and chaſtened his Soul with Faſting; for where Sin goes before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bewailed, Judgments neceſſarily follow after; and a Man may fore-ſee the Effect by the Cauſe; when ſuch ſins as uſually bring Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Acted amongſt us, we may look for
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40419:155"/> the like Effect; for like Sins bring like Plagues, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.20. <hi>I have grievouſly Rebelled:</hi> And what follows? <hi>Abroad the Sword bereaveth, at home there is as Death.</hi> See alſo <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.2,3. And therefore in the prevailing of Sin, we have great cauſe to humble our Souls, and ſtand in the Gap to turn away the fierce Anger of the Lord, and never more Cauſe than at this day. Again, when thou findeſt thy Corruptions ſtrong, and thy Graces weak, or when thou findeſt ſome notable decay in thy Grace, 'tis time then to look about thee. As alſo when thou wouldſt beg any great thing at the Hands of God, go to him by Faſting, and Prayer: Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> begs the Deliverance of God's People out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> according to God's promiſe; he ſeeks to him by Faſting, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.1,2, &amp;c. &amp; 10.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For though God determine to do it, yet will he be ſought to, for ſo great a Mercy; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when ſome Perſons are deſigned for ſome great work in Church, or Common-wealth, it hath uſually been done by Faſting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Thus Chriſt ſpent a whole Night in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, before he choſe his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were ſet apart by Faſting and Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.2,3. And in Caſe of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual deſertion, we ſhould thus ſeek to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.14. And for the furtherance of ſome great Undertaking, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.16. when Corruption is ſtrong, when Ordinary Food wlll not ſerve, we muſt uſe Phyſick. Some Sins, like ſome Devils, go not out but by Prayer
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40419:156"/> and Faſting: Theſe are the times for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Duty; but what is this to <hi>Lent,</hi> or Holy-day Eves, whereon the Papiſts keep their mock-faſts, but come not to humble their Souls for their Sins?</p>

The <hi>Jews</hi> took it ill from God, that he regarded them not: <hi>Wherefore have we Faſted,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and thou ſeeſt not? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we afflicted our our Souls, and thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt no notice?</hi> Iſa. 58.3. <hi>Behold, ſaith God, ye Faſt for ſtrife and Debate, and to ſtrike with the fiſts ef Wickedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen,</hi> &amp;c. Zach. 7.5. <hi>When ye Faſted and Mourned in the fifth and ſeventh Moneth, even theſe ſeventy years, did ye at all Faſt unto me, even to me;</hi> Hoſ. 7.14. <hi>They have not cryed to me with their Hearts, when they howled upon their Beds; they aſſemble themſelves for Corn and Wine, and they Rebel againſt me.</hi> If the Heart be abſent, God regards not the Service. The <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Mat. 6.16,17. they Faſted, but it was to be ſeen of Men, that others might look upon them, as of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteer courſe of Life, and therefore had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from Men, not from God. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> make Merits their End; they Faſt, and think to Merit Heaven by it: But alas! what can poor ſinful Creatures Merit at the Hands of God, but Divine Indignation, and fierce Judgments? God may ſay of us, as of thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12. <hi>When they Faſt, I will not hear
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40419:156"/> their Cry; when they Offer Burnt-Offerings, and an Oblation, I will not accept them; but I will conſume them by the Sword, and by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and by the Peſtilence,</hi> Luke 18 12. <hi>I Faſt twice in the week,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> yet the poor <hi>Publican</hi> was regarded before him: See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 8. Alas! were Men but acquainted with their own Hearts, this conceit of Merit would ſoon vaniſh. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, as I told you, is an indifferent thing, and only uſeful as it ſuits with the main End: <hi>Bodily Exerciſe profiteth little, but Godlineſs is profitable to all things,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.7,8. The true End of Faſting is either Ordinary, or Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, in both the Glory of God is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: The Ordinary Ends are ſuch as theſe; the ſubduing the Fleſh, and bringing the Body into Subjection: Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. <hi>I bring under my Body, and bring it into ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> God's People have Fleſh as well as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and have need to uſe all means to ſubject it, that they may ſubdue their Corruption; and if Ordinary means will not do, Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary muſt be uſed; if the Temptation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, this Duty muſt be followed; and at length God will give ſtrength, and his Grace ſhall be ſufficient for us: This is the way to Corroborate, and ſtrengthen the Spirit, and enable it to perform the required Duties: This puts fervency into our Prayer, and enables us to Cry mightily to God. This way Men take ſome Revenge upon themſelves for their Sin, and for the abuſe of Mercies; by this means
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40419:157"/> a Man is better enabled to grapple with Temptations, and bring under Corruptions, and perform Duties of our General, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling more Heavenly: This is the way to ſtir up the Spirit of Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Thus the Propheteſs <hi>Anna</hi> ſpent her time, <hi>in Serving God with Faſting and Prayer, Night and Day,</hi> Luke 2.37. By Eating and Drinking, the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes dull, and heavy, and unfit for Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Duties; but by moderate abſtinence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more Active and Lively; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faſting and Prayer, are uſually joyned together: For Faſting of it ſelf doth little good; Faſting teſtifies our Humility, our grief, and ſorrow for Sin, whereby we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our guilt before God, and our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of Meat, Drink, Sleep, Raiment, or other refreſhing Comforts. Are theſe the Ends you aim at? Is this the Mark you ſhoot at? And the white that is in your Eye? 'Tis well, if it be, to make you fitter for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Lord, that you may do your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Will better, and wind up the Heart to an higher pitch of Holineſs, and Heavenly mindedneſs: But if Cuſtom, or Faſhion, or the fear of Man, or popular Applauſe, or hopes of Meriting any thing from God, be your End, your Duty will be Curſt, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to you, and be returned Sin into your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. The Extraordinary Ends we aim at in our Faſting, ſhould be the removing of Evil felt, or feared; either Spiritual, or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40419:157"/> from our ſelves, or others; the begging thoſe Mercies we want, and the continuance of thoſe we have, and fear to loſe: Theſe are the Ends the Godly have uſed theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Faſtings for, and this hath been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful to theſe Ends; theſe are means of God's own preſcribing, and promiſes are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a good Succeſs: And many Chriſtians, for themſelves, and others, have found a Comfortable return; and that which could not otherwiſe be obtained, hath been gotten by Prayer and Faſting: But our <hi>Phariſaical,</hi> or <hi>Papiſtical</hi> Faſtings, our looſe, careleſs mock-faſts, never did, nor never will prevail with God for any Mercy, or the removal of any Judgment.</p>

                     </label> In the laſt place, look to thy Carriage after the Duty, that thou demean thy ſelf well; for thy work is not done when the Exerciſe is ended: Take heed of reſting in the Duty, or truſting to the work done; this is <hi>Popiſh,</hi> this will make thee loſe all thy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: 'Tis not the hanging down the Head, as God ſaith, like a Bulruſh, for a day will ſerve thy turn. This, as other Duties, are to be uſed as <hi>Boats,</hi> or <hi>Bridges</hi> to help thee over to Chriſt; Men do not make Boats, or Bridges for their own ſakes, or to look upon, but to make uſe of for the End they are ſuited to; make not Prayer the end of Prayer, or Faſting the end of Faſting: Uſe them not for their own ſakes, but for Chriſt's ſake, to get nearer to him by them; play not with the Stile,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40419:158"/> or Ladder, but Climb up; Climb over by them. Take heed of Priding in the Duty, this is very inconſiſtent with it, if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with enlargement; beware, leſt the Devil Fly-blow it: Pride is a Worm which breeds in the beſt Fruits of the Spirit; yea, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e Ruine of other Sins, even in Humility it ſelf: Men may be proud of their Humility; the Devil, like the Spider, can ſuck Poyſon out of the choiceſt Flowers: If thy Duties be thus fly-blown, they will not down with God; they ſtink in his Noſtrils, whatever conceit thou maiſt have of them. Examine alſo at the cloſe of the Duty, how thy Heart hath demeaned it ſelf in the Duty; if bad, thou haſt cauſe to be humbled, and make thy Heart ſmart for it'; moſt Men, if they Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing, 'tis the External part of the Duty; and are troubled more at a miſ-expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Duty, than at the ſtraying, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the thoughts, or the deadneſs of the Heart: But a Chriſtians work lies moſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; he looks, as God doth, moſt upon the Heart, though the other be not to be diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. If thy Heart hath carried it ſelf well, there is cauſe of thankfulneſs, none of Pride; for who made thee to differ? And what haſt thou that thou haſt not received? View but thy failings, and this may make thee vail thy Peacocks Plumes. Haſt got any ſtrength by the Duty, hold it faſt, and let it not go; art got any thing nearer to God, keep thy ſtation, and go not back; loſe not the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:40419:158"/> ground thou haſt gained by thy Duty: If thy Heart be heated, take heed of letting it cool again, the wind of the World will quickly do it; though the Exerciſe be over, let not thy Spiritual Fervour and Heat be over. <hi>Elijah</hi> walked in the ſtrength of a meals meat forty days; a Chriſtian ſhould exceed him, in ſuch extraordinary meals: What good will it do a Man to work hard all day, and have his work at Night as he found it in the Morning; and to travel hard, and at Night be where he ſet out. Maintain the ground thou haſt gotten in the Fight: Haſt thou put up Petitions to the Throne of Grace, mark how they ſpeed, that thou maiſt behave thy ſelf accordingly: Moſt Men loſe their Prayers, as Boys do their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, they mark not where they light; many know not whether God Anſwers them or no, nor ſcarce what they have asked. But thoſe that are burthened with the Sins they confeſs, and feel the want of the Mercies they deſire, take better heed. An Hungry, or a Thirſty Man, that begs for Meat, or Drink, can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceive, and tell you whether they had a Grant, or a Denial: Another that begs out of wantonneſs, not wants, heeds it not: A Man that deſires to have his Sores Cured, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves how the Plaiſter ſuits with it; when a Beggar, that gains by his Sores, matters it not, though they never are healed. If God ſeem to deny thy Requeſt, 'tis time to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what is the matter; ſee whether it be Lawful, or Convenient, and if ſo, follow
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40419:159"/> thy Suit, give God no reſt; he will firſt or laſt grant thy deſire. Sometimes he deferrs to make his People Cry the louder; if it be a neceſſary thing, take no denyal, thy importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will not Offend God, as we ſee in the Parable of the Importunate Widdow. Many Chriſtians are ſhort-winded, they can Pray but a turn or two, and then are out of breath, like the <hi>Bethulians,</hi> ſoon ready to faint: If thou pray againſt Sin, fight againſt it alſo, hate it, and deteſt it: 'Tis a vain thing to Imagine that God will ſubdue it without our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: If thou pray for Mercy, work for it alſo, this is the way: And enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God to Live more Holily, and more humbly, and perform thy Covenant; <hi>better not to Vow, than to Vow and not perform,</hi> Eccl. 5.5. If God grant thy Requeſt, return thanks; Live thanks, as well as ſpeak thanks: If he ſeem to deny, wait upon him in the uſe of means, and he will Anſwer in due time.</p>

                  <p>THE next Duty which I ſhall mention, is Holy Feaſting, which is no part of God's Worſhip, but is helpful to the Duty of Thankſgiving, as Faſting is to Humiliation; it hath been in uſe in the times of the Law, and is not uſeleſs in the times of the Goſpel, where there is juſt Cauſe for ſuch Spiritual Rejoycing. God in the Time of the Law appointed ſeveral Feaſts to be Obſerved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon ſeveral Occaſions. Some Daily, as the Morning and Evening Sacrifice; ſome Weekly, as the Sabbath, in Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Work of Creation, and to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie out our Eternal Reſt in Heaven. Some Occaſionally, as the Thankſgiving of <hi>Moſes, Deborah,</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> &amp;c. Some Yearly; and theſe either greater or leſſer Feaſts; the greater Feaſts were three; the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be kept in Memorial of <hi>Iſraels</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which Typically holds out our Deliverance by Chriſt, who was the true Paſcal Lamb ſlain for the ſins of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; of this Feaſt we may read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; 23.15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 42.21. and elſewhere. The next was <hi>Penticoſt,</hi> which was obſerved
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40419:160"/> fifty days after; wherein every Family Offered two Loaves of the firſt Fruits: This is called the Feaſt of Harveſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. The third was the Feaſt of Tabernacles, Inſtituted in Memory, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Lived forty Years in the Wilderneſs, and had no certain Dwelling Houſes, but Lived in Tents, and yet God made Proviſion for them; and hereby they were Taught, and we may Learn, if we are Strangers and Pilgrims here, and have no conſtant abiding City, but expect one in the Spiritual <hi>Canaan;</hi> we may find this Feaſt mentioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. where 'tis called the Feaſt of In gathering, at the end of the Year. At theſe three Feaſts all the Males were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to appear before the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7. The Annual Feaſts of leſſer Account, were two; the Feaſt of Trumpets, and the Feaſt of Expiation, both mentioned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.24.27. In which alſo it was not allowed to do any Work; nay, it was forbidden upon pain of Death: Other Feaſts were to be Obſerved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certain Years; for as every ſeventh day was Holy to the Lord, ſo was every ſeventh Year: For as Man and Beaſt was Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Reſt upon the ſeventh day; ſo the Land was to Reſt every ſeventh Year, that it might gather Heart, and that the Poor of the Land might be fed of thoſe things which the Earth did Naturally bring forth, without Labour; and after ſeven times ſeven Years, which is forty nine, the next, which is the fiftyeth
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40419:160"/> Year, was the Jubilee, or Year of Gladneſs, wherein Debts were forgiven, Land ſold, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Owners, and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Servants were Releaſed, and made Free, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.9. To which Chriſt ſeems to allude, <hi>John</hi> 4.18,19. who was ſent to Preach the Acceptable Year of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some Feſtivals alſo were appointed by Man, upon great Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and were Yearly Obſerved by the Church; as the Feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Eſther</hi> the Queen, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> upon the Account, and in Memorial of the Famous Deliverance of the Church in their time from the wicked Conſpiracy of <hi>Haman, Eſt.</hi> 9.17. And alſo the Feaſt of the <hi>Dedication</hi> of the Temple, either after the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.16. Or after it was polluted by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and again Dedicated by <hi>Machabeus,</hi> 1 Mac. 4.5,6. Which Feaſt Chriſt himſelf ſeems to approve, by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>John</hi> 10.22. And in Goſpel times we have our Feaſts alſo; as every Seventh day for a Sabbath, of which I have already Treated: Several other Feſtivals in later Ages have been Obſerved, which Antienter Antiquity make no mention of, as ſeveral in Memory of Chriſt's Birth, Reſurrection, Aſſention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Several to our Lady, and many in Memory of Saints; of which I ſhall ſay no more, but what the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5,6. <hi>One Man eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one day above another; another eſteemeth every day alike, let every Man be perſwaded fully in his own mind,</hi> &amp;c. Let us not Judge one
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40419:161"/> another in thoſe things; but were thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as days of Thankſgiving ought to be, they would not be ſo eagerly contended for by ſome, nor ſo eagerly contended againſt by others. The Papiſts ſuperſtitiouſly forcing them upon us, as parts of Gods worſhip; and their Idol worſhip thereupon hath made ſome perhaps, run too far on the other ſide; but many ſpending them as Feaſts to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> hath made many abhor the other occaſional Feaſts we have had, as the fifth of <hi>November, &amp;c.</hi> commanded by Authority to be greatly obſerved, and others as occaſion falls out; which if you would keep well, or any of the forementioned Holy-days, obſerve theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections following.</p>

                     </label> If thou wouldeſt offer up to God a pleaſing Sacrifice upon ſuch a day as this is, get thy heart rightly qualified, and rightly prepared; there is bad Muſick like to be where the Inſtrument is out of tune: this Duty is more difficult than Prayer; pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wants, and eminent dangers, puts a Man on to prayer, as we ſee by the Mariners in <hi>Jonah's</hi> Ship; but ſelf-denyal is required in praiſing him: ten <hi>Lepers</hi> could join in a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for help, and but one returned to give thanks. Thy heart muſt be qualified with Grace, or thou canſt not praiſe God upon ſuch occaſions as thou oughteſt: for what haſt thou to do to take the Word, or Name of God in thy Mouth, if thou hateſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. 'Tis every ones duty,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40419:161"/> for every one receives mercy, and 'tis a Rent due to the chief Land Lord, but every one cannot do it; <hi>Praiſe is comely for the upright, Pſal.</hi> 38.1. It ſhould be a Congregation of Saints where God is praiſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.11. I do not perſwade others from the Duty, no more than I do from Prayer, but perſwade them to cleanſe their hearts before they come to the Duty: for none but the Righteous can do the work of the day as they ought, neither indeed have they cauſe to rejoice when God is their Enemy; and for ought they know, they may Lodge next night in Hell: that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing is the work of the day, is evident <hi>Lev.</hi> 23,40. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.12. and many other places.

Thy evidence muſt be cleared up, or thou art unfit for this Duty. Thoſe, and thoſe only, that have an intereſt in Chriſt, and a Title to Glory, aſſured to them, can eat their Bread with Joy, and drink their Wine with a merry heart: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Others may ſpeak as much, and ſeem as confident, like the <hi>Phariſee;</hi> but there is a difference: the true Chriſtian ſpeaks humbly, the <hi>Phariſee</hi> proudly, and boaſtingly: the one is humbled for his remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40419:162"/> corruption, the other brags, though no ſin is kill'd. <hi>Paul</hi> cryes out, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of Death?</hi> The Phariſee thanks God, he is not as other Men are, or as the Pulican: The one thanks God for what he hath, the other for what he never had. How oft may we hear Men give thanks, for their Election, Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when there is little appearance of it, when their lives evidence, that they are neither called, nor ſanctified: the one praiſeth God in pity to others, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in contempt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. To me who am leſs than the leaſt of Saints, is this Grace given. I thank thee, ſaith the Phariſee I am not as other Men are: One returns thanks out of Cuſtome; the other out of Conſcience. For preparation to the work, diſpoſe of, and lay aſide, all thy Worldly occaſions, as much as poſſible; that they interupt thee not in the work: and take daily notice of, and ſtore up in thy Memory, what God hath done for thy Body, and for thy Soul, for thy Family and Relations, for the Land of thy Nativity; and the Church in general. How ſhall we praiſe God, if we neglect, and forget his benefits? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2. his Works and wonders, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.7. this is commanded, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.8.

                     </label> When thou keepeſt a day, keep it to the Lord, and not to thy ſelf. Let thy ultimate end and aim be Gods glory, and the main deſign thou driveſt on be his praiſe: 'tis true in all Duties this ſhould be regarded; but eſpecially in this: for this Time is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part meerly upon that account, to praiſe him with an inlarged heart; and if thou propound lower ends than theſe, God will not own thy work. Theſe days are appointed to praiſe God, and not as many abuſe them, and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the Fleſh; 'tis the Apoſtles advice, and doubtleſs our Duty, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever you do, do all to the praiſe and glory of God.</hi> And if in our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40419:163"/> courſe we ſhould drive on this deſign, much more in this extraordinary Duty, in ſo ſolemn a day, and exerciſe; here the joy of the Lord ſhould fill the heart, Spiritual and not Carnal Joy, &amp; the praiſe of the Lord ſhould fill our Mouths, not vain laughter: we ſhould ſpeak out the great works of God, which he hath done for our Souls; and whatſoever ſuits not with this, is unſuitable for the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but 'tis a ſad thing, that many that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Conſcience in the obſervation of Saints-days, blame all thoſe thot look upon them as indifferent. I ſay, that thoſe to whom honeſt Labour, at other times Lawful, is held a great Tranſgreſſion, yet make no Conſcience at all of ſerving God upon theſe days; but ſpend their time vainly, and prophanely, neither to the benefit of Soul, or Body. Theſe think they ſerve God better at an Ale-houſe, at a Cock-pit, or Bear-baiting, or Stage-play; at Cards, or Dice, or other unlawful Games, than they can in an honeſt Calling: But is this the Feaſt that God hath choſen, to eat and drink, and riſe up to play? This may ſerve turn, if we worſhiped ſuch an Idol as <hi>Iſrael</hi> then did, <hi>Fxod.</hi> 32.6. But ſhall we ſerve our God with ſuch ſervice, as the <hi>Heathen</hi> did <hi>Baccus?</hi> He is a Spirit, and muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped in Spirit, and in Truth; and is eating and drinking, to Gluttony and Drunkenneſs this Spiritual Service that is commanded? Shall we praiſe God for his Creatures, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and abuſe of them? Yet are not
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40419:163"/> theſe the Exerciſes of ſome of the greateſt Sticklers for ſuch Feſtivals? Look into an Ale-houſe, and ſee whether more meet not there upon ſuch days as theſe, than the whole Week beſide; and many an Oath ſworn, and many a Lye told, and many a vain word ſpoken, at ſuch times, and upon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yea, much Drunkenneſs, Debauchery, Quarrels, Fightings; and ſometimes Murder, is there committtd. And is this Gods Feaſt, or the Devils Sacrifice? It more ſuits an <hi>Heathen</hi> Idol, than an holy God. Is this the place where God is like to meet thee? or wouldeſt have Death meet thee here? or is the Diſcourſe of the Company ſuitable to the work of the Day, wilt thou thank God for thy Reaſon, when thou haſt loſt the uſe of it by drinking; and transformed thy ſelf into a Beaſt? or canſt then remember Gods benefits to praiſe him for them, when thou canſt not remember what thou doſt? 'Tis far from me to Judge any Man that keeps thoſe days, as days of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ought to be kept: And 'tis far from me to approve of them as they are kept. I know the Godly are allowed to eat their Bread with Joy, and drink their Wine with a merry heart; but it is Spiritual, not Carnal Joy: They ought upon Thanksgiving days, to ceaſe from their Labour; but that is not all, then they keep it but as a Beaſt: But as a Faſt is a help to humiliation, and makes Prayers the more fervent; ſo Feaſting in an holy manner elevates the Soul, and makes praiſes the more
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40419:164"/> hearty, when we freſhly taſt Gods goodneſs in the Previſion made for us: Labour in both is forbidden, as 'tis an hindrance in the Duties in hand: but 'tis ſad that God is more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored in thoſe days pretended to be ſet apart to honour him in, than in all the days of the Year beſides; but God will not own ſuch Servants, nor accept of ſuch Service, when Men think there is nothing but work forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon that day, or nothing more than idleneſs required; but many would glorifie God much better in a Lawful Calling, than at an unlawful Exerciſe, or unneceſſary Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know Recreation is Lawful, as I hope in due time and place to demonſtrate and give Directions in it: But why ſhould we take Gods time for our uſe? if theſe days be appropriated to Gods Service, let them be ſpent in his Service; if for our Recreation, let us never put the Title of Holy-days upon them, let them be left indifferent, to be uſed, or not uſed, at pleaſure, or People kept from diſhonouring God in them.</p>

'Tis true, Thanksgiving is a work of every day; but every day is not to be obſerved as an holy Feſtival to God: come not ſuperſtitiouſly to it, as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely, as the Senſualiſt, nor wickedly, as the profane Enmies to God, and Godlineſs: See thou be invited to it, by real mercies received; and in giving thanks, miſtake not Judgements
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40419:164"/> for Mercies, and Mercies for Judgments; 'tis, true, we ought to Obſerve all God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and Bleſs God for all Chaſtiſements, as well as others, that is for the good which we receive by them, as <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. But this ſhould be with Humiliation, not Exultation: If thy Foundation be rotten, the Building can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good; there are many that heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and give thanks alſo to God, after their manner, for the downfall of the Church, and the extirpation of the Power of Godlineſs. I fear our times are not barren of Examples, of this Nature: This was the Sin of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> and will be the Sin of thoſe that are guilty, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.6. <hi>Becauſe thou hast clapped thy Hands, and ſtamped with thy Feet, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in thine Heart, with all deſpight againſt the Land of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>therefore I will ſtretch forth my hand againſt thee, and deliver thee for a ſpoil to the Heathen,</hi> &amp;c. See, God takes it ill, when Men exult over his People in diſtreſs; and if they praiſe him for Correcting them, 'tis unpleaſing Service to him; his Ends are their Reformation, not their deſolation, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.15. <hi>I am ſorely diſpleaſed with the Heathen that are at eaſe, for I was but a very little diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and they helpt forward the Affliction:</hi> There is a Prophetick Prayer put up againſt <hi>Edom,</hi> which in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Troubles Cryed, <hi>Raſe it, Raſe it, even to the Foundations thereof,</hi> Pſal. 137.7. God made the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> a Rod in his Hand to Correct his People, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deſtroy them; but God threatens

Let the manner of the performance of this thankfulneſs be what it will, never ſo ſpecious in the Eyes of Man, if the ground of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing be the Ruine of the Church, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the People of God, the extirpation of the power of Godlineſs, or the Liberty of Prophaneſs, or Increaſe of it; 'tis abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſight of God, and thy Feaſt will pleaſe God no better than <hi>Jezebels</hi> Faſt, where God's Laws were broken, under pretence of his Honour. The like pretence we may read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5. <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his Word, your Brethren that hate you, and caſt you out for my ſake, ſaid, let the Lord
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40419:165"/> be Glorified, but he ſhall appear to your Joy, and their ſhame.</hi> Some think God is Glorified, when indeed he is diſhonoured; Men ſhall kill you, ſaith Chriſt, and think they do God good Service: Oh, the miſchie of Ignorance, and Superſtition! But the Godly, in all Ages, have made the Flouriſhing of the Church, and the down-fall of implacable Enemies, the Cauſe of ſuch Rejoycing; and not when one part of the Church ruins another, and imbrues their Hands in one anothers Blood; this is Cauſe of Lamentation. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> though in a juſt Quarrel, and by God's appointment, yet they lift up their Voyce and wept, becauſe one Tribe was Cut off, <hi>Judg.</hi> 21.2.6. And 'tis ſaid, they Repented for their Brother <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi>'s ſake. 'Tis Cauſe of mourning when Proteſtants ſhed each others Blood, and the Enemies laugh at it, in their Sleeves: And for Perſonal Mercy, ſee it be ſuch as God hath really given thee, and not like the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,</hi> for thoſe thou haſt not. As for Election, Redemption, Vocation, Juſtification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and the hopes of Glory, theſe well deſerve thy greateſt praiſe, but boaſt not of them before thou haſt ſome good ground to believe thou haſt them; God will not thank that Man, that thanks him for Gifts and Graces, which he never did, and, perhaps, never will beſtow upon him.</p>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40419:170"/> hath his Mercies been to us? How ſtrange was his bringing us out of Popiſh darkneſs? How wonderful his preſerving us from being reduced back again? How great his Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the <hi>Spantſh</hi> Invaſion, and after from the Powder Treaſon, and many other Helliſh Plots, hatc'd in Hell, againſt God's People upon Earth: How hath he continued our Peace, our Plenty, our Health, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; yea, the Goſpel among us, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Rage and Malice of the Devil, and his Inſtruments. If we conſider our own particular Mercies, and that as we are Men, or as we are Chriſtians: As a Man, thou art his Creature, and ſhouldſt bleſs him for thy Creation; he made thee of nothing, when he had no need of thee; he made thee a rational Creature, capable of Communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he might have made thee a Dog, or Toad, or the moſt deſpicable Creature that ever fell out of his hands: And doth not this deſerve praiſe? He covered thee in thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, and through him thou waſt born: <hi>David</hi> bleſſeth him for that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.13. Thou waſt born in an Age of Light, under the Goſpel, thou mighteſt have been born in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi> or <hi>India,</hi> or the moſt barbarous place in <hi>America;</hi> he provided for thee, when thou couldeſt not provide for thy ſelf: he gives thee Food and Raiment, and bleſſeth them to thy Uſe, without which they could not Feed thee, or keep thee warm: he hath given thee thy Limbs, and Senſes, when thou mighteſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40419:170"/> have been blind, or lame; or deaf, or dumb: Thou haſt thy health, and ſtrength, thy wit and reaſon, when thou mighteſt have been upon thy Bed of Languiſhing, or running ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the Streets; thou haſt fire and water, two great Favours, were they wanted; thou haſt the ground to tread upon, the Air to breath in, which thou haſt not deſerved; and many thouſand other Mercies, and canſt not yet ſee Cauſe to be thankful? Peace and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Health and Liberty, is given in to thee: But if thou art a Chriſtian, thy Obligations are much more; thou ſhouldeſt then praiſe God for his Electing Love, when he paſt by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and ſet his Love on thee; for ſending his Son into the world, and for Chriſts Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thy Sins; for his Redeeming of thee with his precious blood, for his Adopting thee to be his Child; his Calling, Sanctifying, and Juſtifying thee for the Grace he hath given thee, the promiſes he hath made to thee for the Goſpel of his Son given to thee, for his Spirit to direct thee, his Miniſters to teach thee, thy own Conſcience to check thee, the Company of his Servants to encourage thee, and generally for all the helps thou haſt in Heavens way, ſtrength againſt Temptations, Corruptions, and Alurements. Now, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, canſt ſee any Cauſe of thankfulneſs?

                  <head>CHAP. XV. Directions in Private Duties.</head>
                  <p>HAving already Diſcourſed of the Publick parts of Gods worſhip, which for the moſt part are performed in the Congregation; and given you Directions for the right perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, as God hath enabled me; I ſhall now in the Cloſe of this Treatiſe, ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe private Duties that every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is bound to perform in their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or Cloſets, when they are out of the great Congregation, for this is no leſs God's Worſhip than the former; and doth as much, nay, more demonſtrate a Man to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and Evidence the Truth of Grace, than the former; that is, a Chriſtian that is ſo when no Eye, but the Eye of God is upon him. I ſhall Treat of theſe more briefly, becauſe thoſe Directions for Publick Worſhip already given, will many of them fall in to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40419:173"/> here: 'Tis not enough to be a Chriſtian in Publick, when the Eyes of the World are upon thee, but in private alſo. A Hypocrite may be zealous abroad, that is looſe at home; Holy in the Congregation, and Prophane in the Cloſet; mindful of Publick Duties, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of Private: But a true Chriſtian is <hi>ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per idem,</hi> always the ſame, in all places, in all Companies, at all times, and in all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he is like clear water in a Glaſs, ſhake it as long as you will, it remains clear: But a Hypocrite by ſhaking diſcovers mud in the bottom; or like the Needle in the Compaſs, though it may be diſturbed by a jog, or ſhake, will never fix upon a wrong point. The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> they loved to pray in the Temple, and in the Corners of the Streets, where they might be ſeen of Men, but there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of their Cloſet Duties; but Chriſt bids enter into the Cloſet, and ſhut the Door. Chriſtianity is a Race, in which we muſt run, whether we have Company or no; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men behold us or no. A true Chriſtian is no ſooner in the ſtate of Grace, but he cries out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And thinks he can never do enough for Chriſt, that hath done ſo much for him; he knows he is not his own, but bought with a price, and therefore will Glorifie God, with his Body, and with his Soul, which are God's. When an Hypocrite Dedicates his Hands and Tongue to Chriſt, a true Chriſtian Dedicates his Heart: A Hypocrites work is moſt in ſight,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40419:173"/> a true Chriſtians is moſt in Secret; the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites is moſt abroad, the others is moſt at home; the Love of God conſtrains the one, and popular Applauſe drives on the other: A true Chriſtian Devotes himſelf wholly to God's Service, and Serve him he will, not for a Reward only, but for Love, to him, and his Work; and will do his Duty, whatever danger, or difficulty lyes in his way; for as he draws out from Chriſt ſtrength to perform every Duty, and bear every Affliction, ſo he draws out from Chriſt all the ſtrength he hath in his Service; Heart, and Hand, and Tongue, and all ſhall be ſet on work for him; and he reſolves he will ſerve him in Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, all the days of his Life. 'Tis the Hypocrite that picks and chuſeth his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; this he will do, and that he will not do; a true Chriſtian takes Duties as they lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and refuſeth none for danger, or difficulty; private Duties go down with him as well as publick, he makes as much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Secret Duties, when no Eye, but the All-ſeeing Eye of God is upon him, as in publick, when the Congregation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves him. The Thoughts what Chriſt hath done, and Suffered for him, makes him think he can never do enough for Chriſt. 'Tis a true Token of a hard heart, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God's Mercy, and Chriſt's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, do not bend him to Duty; and of all the Judgments in the World, a hard heart is one of the greateſt: Ah! what Cauſe have
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40419:174"/> Men therefore to look about them, who feel this Diſeaſe creeping upon them. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, thoſe that are in Chriſt are new Creatures; that they have put on Chriſt, and live not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit: that they are dead to Sin, and alive to God; and have Crucified the World, with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and Luſts thereof: how then is their Aſſurance grounded, that conceit themſelves to be in Chriſt, and ſhall be ſaved, when none of all theſe things appear in them? nay though the contrary appear; though they live in Sin, and do the Devil's work: look to it betimes, God will not be mocked; his Servants ye are to whom ye obey, if ye ſuffer not with him, you will not Reign with him; as you Sow you ſhall Reap, God will have the heart, or nothing: if thou wilt to Heaven, thou muſt be a Chriſtian; and a Chriſtian thou canſt not be, but thou muſt be one in Private, as well as in Publick; which that thou may'ſt be, take theſe Directions for Private Duties.</p>

                     </label> The firſt Duty I ſhall mention, but not of leaſt concernment, is ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This indeed is private, for it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and thine own heart. Be often enquiring at home, what ſtate thy Soul ſtands in to God; and what intereſt thou haſt in the Blood of Chriſt, and what Title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: this is a neceſſary, though much neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Duty. Many that caſt up their Shops, to ſee whether they grow, or decreaſe in the World: and try their Evidences for their
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:40419:174"/> Lands, to ſee that they are good; take not ſo much pains for the Soul, to ſee whether all be well there. Union, and Communion with God, is a Chriſtians chiefeſt happineſs; and without this, there can be no felicity, though we have the influence of all Earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yea, though we had the Honours, Riches, and Pleaſures, of a thouſand Worlds: for all theſe end in a Snuff, and will prove vaniſhing, fading, tranſitory things. The Soul of Man is a precious Piece, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be moſt regarded. 'Tis next to the Angels, the chiefeſt Piece that ever drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the hands of God, and was made in his own Image; and the nearer any thing comes to the Image of God, the nearer it comes to perfection: for God is Perfection it ſelf. 'Tis the greateſt Purchaſe of the Blood of Chriſt, that which was of Infinite Value, more worth than the World, was given to redeem it; and Chriſt knew well enough the worth of Souls: and would not give ſuch a Rate for a thing of little worth. In a word, 'tis Eternal, and ſhall laſt for ever; and run parallel with the longeſt Line of Eternity, and therefore pretious: the vanity of Earthly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments is ſeen in this, as well as other things, it's uncertain, and momentary durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now this pretious and Immortal Piece, is in great danger; and without our care, diligence, and pains, is like to be loſt: a thouſand Enemies beſiege it, and ſet it round, Enemies without, and within, and on every
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40419:175"/> ſide: without the Devil, and the World, who ſpread a thouſand Snares to intrap it: within, Corruptions, yea an inbred Traytor; a falſe, perfideous, treacherous, and deceitful heart: theſe are Politick, Subtile, Crafty, and malicious Enemies. The Devil will make no peace with us, but upon worſe conditions, than <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the <hi>Amonite</hi> offered to the Men of <hi>Jabiſh Gillead,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this condition will I make a Covenant with you; that I may thruſt out all your right Eyes, and lay it for a Reproach upon all</hi> Iſrael: but his conditions are the everlaſting deſtruction of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and if the Soul be once loſt, thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever; a thouſand Worlds cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it, though they were turned into a heap of Diamonds, or a Globe of Gold: Now, art thou a rational Creature? and canſt thou ſee thy ſelf, thy better part, in ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and art not ſenſible of it? wilt thou ſo regard a Limb, or Sence, an Eye, or a Tooth, and ſhall the Soul be unregarded? wilt thou Conſult the Lawyer about thy Eſtate, the Phyſitian about thy Health, yea the Farrier about thy Horſes; and ſhall thy Soul be neglected? God forbid: Wilt take care for Trifles, and neglect things of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concernment; what greater note of a Fool can be expreſſed? God is yet calling thee, and the Door of Mercy is not yet ſhut againſt thee, opportunities are yet offered thee, and there is yet hopes; but how long it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thou knoweſt not: up and be doing,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:40419:175"/> make ſure of Heaven while it may be had; one of theſe days it will be too late: examine thy ſelf by the Word of God, cleanſe the Fountain, that the Streams may be clear; ſtub up the Root of Sin, when others are Lopping at the Branches; begin Reformation at the right end. I ſhould here have given you ſome Motives, Rules, Directions, Marks, and Characters; to this purpoſe, to guide you in this difficult work, but this I have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in another Treatiſe of that Subject, called <hi>the Souls Looking-Glaſs,</hi> to which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr you, if you have no better at hand. Yea when by Examination thou knoweſt the truth of thy Grace, yet is not Examination uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but conſider the Growth of it alſo: true Grace is of a growing Nature, like a Grain of Muſtard Seed; that in time becomes a great Tree: thy Growth ſhould be in ſome meaſure anſwerable to the Food thou eateſt, the means of Grace thou enjoyeſt: that which ſtands at a ſtay, or declines, may be ſuſpected 'tis not true; 'tis a Monſter in Nature, that is no bigger at twenty Years old, than at two; 'tis ſad when Men that ſhould grow, decline, and loſe their firſt love: if this be thy caſe, conſider from whence thou art fallen, and do thy firſt work; conſider who thou leaveſt, and whither thou goeſt, and what will be the Iſſue of it; at leaſt conſider what thou doſt, which no Hypocrite in the World can do: and never give thy ſelf any reſt, till thou knoweſt that thou outſtrip'ſt them all; yea, till
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40419:176"/> thou canſt Read thy Name Written in the Book of Life, and canſt call God Father; and ſay with the Spouſe, <hi>my Beloved is mine, and I am his, Cant.</hi> 6.3.</p>

                     </label> The next Private Duty is, when thou knoweſt that thou haſt an Intereſt in God, and a Title to Glory; and canſt without check of Conſcience, call God thy Father, and Chriſt thy Head and Husband: be ſure then to keep cloſe to him, hold him faſt, and do not let him go, like the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> that they Walked with God; and thus in ſome meaſure doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very faithful Soul, and this is the ſureſt, ſafeſt, courſe thou canſt take: for there is none can hurt thee when thou art under his Wing, no Enemy can moleſt thee, while thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Tuition; trouble never grinds a Man, till it finds him from God; take heed of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrange with God: if thou ſuffer him to be gone, thou may'ſt ſeek him ſorrowing, and not find him. Many that are conſtant in Publick Duties, are defective in Private; but 'tis Secret Duties, that chiefly maintains Communion with God: in thoſe it is we moſt ingage our hearts to God, and God to us: now if thou wouldeſt keep this Communion with God, ſome things are to be avoided, ſome things done: The things to be avoided are eſpecially Sins, but above all, our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Sins, thoſe that thou art moſt inclined to, and moſt eaſiieſt yeilds to; and canſt moſt hardly ſay nay: theſe God is moſt Jealous of,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40419:176"/> and theſe will make the greateſt breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul; and moſt havock among thy Graces; theſe are they that moſt deeply wound the Conſcience, break thy Peace with thy God; and if not forſaken, will procure a Bill of Divorce: 'tis thy Sins which is the cauſe of all Judgement, Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Spiritual, and Eternal; and withhold Mercies from thee: The love of Sin, and cloſe walking with God, cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sin is to Holy Spiritual Communion with God, as Water is to Fire, of an extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Nature: take heed therefore of the beginning of it; bruſh and daſh <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Children when they are young, and the Cockatrice Eggs, before they break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Serpents: entertain not a delightful thought of any Sin, reſiſt the firſt motions of Sin, avoid all the occaſions, repell the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and beware of the appearances of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and get as far from it as poſſibly thou canſt: for God, and Sin cannot be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Lodge together in one Soul; thou muſt either break thy Peace with the one, or with the other of theſe irrevocable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: thou canſt not ſerve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: all Sin is of this nature, yet ſome Sins are more abominable than others, as Worldly-mindedneſs, this will choak all that is good in thee; it were the Cares of the World, and the deceitfulneſs of Riches, that choaked the Word, and it became unfruitful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. Pride alſo, is a damning Sin; and makes
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40419:177"/> a Man ſet himſelf in the place of God, and ſet up his own will for his Rule: this turned <hi>Angels</hi> out of Heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice, and many into Hell. Idolatry alſo is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, when Men ſet up other Gods, and ſerve them, God will not take it at their hands: many more there are, of which we muſt be careful: Some things likewiſe are to be done, yea every Duty adds ſome ſtrength, and helps forward this Communion: Private Meditations, and Private Prayers, are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent helps to this end: Meditation is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent help hereunto. Ah what ſweet, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful taſts of of God may a Man have, that Exerciſeth himſelf in this Soul-fatting Duty: Such a Man can find God in every Creature; and like the <hi>Bee,</hi> ſuck ſweetneſs from every Weed, and Flower; he can get advantage by Proſperity, and Adverſity, Health, and Sickneſs; yea every thing he knows, ſees, or hears of: yea every Creature will lead ſuch a Man to God, and Teach him ſome Leſſon worth his Learning: for as by the Vein the Mineral may be found, or as the Stream leads to the Fountain, ſo every thing leads to God; and points out his Power, Wiſdome, and Goodneſs; yea the conſideration and thoughts of Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, Word, and Works, may fill the Soul with admiration, and make a Man fall in love with God; every Chapter, Verſe, and Line, of Holy Writ, is as a Ladder to lift thee nearer Heaven, and draw thee nearer unto
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40419:177"/> God: ſuch a Man knows how to Spiritualiſe every Evil and Morall Action; and what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he doth, he can Ingage God for to reward him: he can ſuck ſweetneſs out of all croſs Providences, and when God ſeems to frown, can turn the Curtain aſide, and ſee his pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Face; and view his Love in the dark Paſſages of his Providence. Another means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Communion is Secret Prayer, when the Soul can power out it ſelf into the Boſome of Chriſt, with Faith and Fervency; who hath promiſed to grant whatever they ask in his Name: Ah what ſweet Crumbs of Comfort, doth many feel coming from Chriſt in ſuch a Suit, when a Man ſpreads his Caſe, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint before Chriſt, as ſomtimes <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did the Blaſphemous Letter: how doth this Ingage God in his Cauſe, if thou maintaineſt Life in theſe two Duties, thou wilt maintain Communion with God, and Life in thy Soul?</p>

Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation alſo is a fruitful Duty; even that which is occaſional: whereby thou mayſt gather Obſervations, and learn many Leſſons
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40419:178"/> for thy Souls good, from every Creature thou haſt to deal with; but this I have already treated of: but this is not all, but if thou art Converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren: we were not Born for our ſelves. If thou haſt a Family, ſtuddy and endeavour their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo; teacheh them in the way they ſhould walk: for to that purpoſe God hath given thee Authority over them; thou art a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet, in thine own Houſe: Rule then in thy Family, as a King, Inſtruct as a Prophet, and Pray amongſt them as a Prieſt; God will be ſerved in thy Family, as well as in thy Cloſet, or in the Publick: therefore, ſomtimes, Particular Houſes are called Churches; becauſe in them God is Worſhiped: To this End prepare then what thou canſt, for the Publick Ordinance, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, Admonition, and Encouragement; remove what rubs thou canſt out of their way, to believing, and obeying; ſhew them the neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt, and obedience to Chriſt; and if thou canſt help it, let none ſerve thee, that will not ſerve God; this was <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Require an Account at their hands, what they learn, and what benefit they receive: preſs theſe things more upon their Spirits, and faſten it upon their Mind, that it may not be let ſlip, by repeating the Sermons, or ſo much of it as ſhall be neceſſary, for their good; and preſs home, and drive at what the Miniſter drives at in his Sermon: Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40419:178"/> alſo is an uſeful means to encreaſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in thy ſelf and Family; and ſhould be done in Private in thy Family, and in Secret by thy ſelf; redeem time to this End, and if poſſible, make them underſtand what they Read, drive the Nail to the Head; this is the way to expell Ignorance, and to get Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: this cannot but work ſome Knowledge in the hearts of them that hear it. In this Word is contained the Wfll of God, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mans Obedience: and here is a Legacy left us by our Fathers Will, the Promiſes which are our Evidences for Heaven; and all we have to ſhew for Glory: and ſhall this be neglected by us, or meanly eſteemed.

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40419:179"/> of the Duty of Prayer in general, and have given Directions in the managing well the Duty; look back upon them, and take the Directions, I ſhall now preſs upon thee as thou art an Houſholder: and 'tis no doubt but Secret Prayer is thy Duty, becauſe thou haſt Secret Sins to Confeſs that none knows of but God, and thine own Soul; and Secret wants to beg ſupplyes for, and Perſonal Mercies to be thankful for. But though this be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 'tis not ſufficient; but if thou have a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, theſe alſo muſt ſhare in thy Prayers: There is a Divine Imprecation againſt all thoſe Families that call not upon the Name of God. Now, this Duty ſhould be daily done; yea, Evening, and Morning, I think may Evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be proved; that 'tis a daily Duty cannot be denyed: The Scripture requires us to pray without ceaſing, to pray continually, and in every thing to give thanks, and ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; intimating to us, that our Souls ſhould be in a continual Praying Temper, and upon all Occaſions Offered, ready to perform this Duty; and we ought to Serve God all the days of our Lives in Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.75. Now, Prayer and Praiſe is part of that daily Service we owe to him, which is alſo Typified out by the daily Sacrifices, and Oblations, which were Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in the Time of the Law; Chriſtians Prayer and Praiſe being in alluſion to this, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the <hi>Offering up the Calves of our Lips,</hi> Hoſ. 4.2. And when Chriſt Teacheth his
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40419:180"/> Diſciples to Pray, he bids them ſay, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread,</hi> which ſhews us thus much, that it was to be their daily Petition, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1. We Read, that the Apoſtles went into the Temple at the hour of Prayer, which ſhews they had their <hi>Stata precibus tempora,</hi> their appointed hours. And the Godly in all Ages have made Prayer their daily Practice: <hi>David</hi> he Prays ſeven times a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.164. <hi>Morning and Evening,</hi> Pſal. 92.2. <hi>Morning, Evening, and at Noon,</hi> Pſal. 55.17. Yea, elſewhere at Midnight. <hi>Daniel</hi> Prayed three times a day conſtantly; yea, when Death was threatned for ſo doing, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. And there is great reaſon for it, for we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive daily Mercies, for which we have cauſe to be thankful; and Commit daily ſins, for which we have cauſe to be humbled; and we have need of daily Supplyes, for which we have cauſe to be earneſt: And God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us leave to come as oft as we will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to hear us, and ſupply us: What a needleſs ſcruple then is it to ask whether it be our Duty, when 'tis our Priviledge, as well as our Duty; we do not ask, how prove you it to be our Duty to eat Meat every day, this would Argue but a bad Stomack: The oftner we come to God, the better welcom we ſhall be, and have more Communion, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him; and the more we Converſe with him the better Entertainment we are like to have. Others Scruple, whether a Man ought to pray in his Family; theſe Men would
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40419:180"/> fain find a knot in a Ruſh, and would Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel the Duty they like not; but doth not God tell us, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together, he will be in the midſt of them,</hi> Mat. 18.20. And are not ſome Families called Churches of God, where Religious Exerciſes are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Philem.</hi> 2.

And <hi>Joſhua</hi> reſolves that he, and his Houſe would ſerve the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. And we read of Chriſt praying with his Diſciples, and others: What ground of doubt can then remain, but this is a Duty? Thoſe that ſhake off this, would willingly ſhake off all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and the reſt of the Commands. In a Family are many particular Family-ſins Committed, which ought to be Confeſſed; many Family Mercies beſtowed, which call for a thankful acknowledgment; many wants, and Infirmities to be ſupplyed, which ſhould be begged; and all theſe cannot be known, nor, perhaps, are fit to be expreſſed by him, that is the Mouth of the People in publick; and for Morning, and Evening, theſe times ſeem fitteſt for this Duty, though ſome Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel this alſo: God himſelf in the time of the Law appointed theſe for Sacrifices, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and Reaſon ſpeaks it fit that in the Morning we ſhould praiſe God for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Night, and pray for a bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the buſineſs of the day; and at Even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſins of the day, and be thankful for

                     </label> Another private Duty which lyes upon thee in reference to thy Family, and thoſe under thy Charge, is reproving them when they ſin, and Correcting them when they will not amend, and reſtraining them what in thee lyes, from breaking God's Laws, and Divine Commands: Thou art God's Vice-gerent in thy Family, and beareſt his Image, and the ſtamp of Authority is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and muſt Imitate God in thy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo far as thy Commiſſion reaches; though thou haſt not the power of Life and Death, as the Supreme Magiſtrate, yet haſt thou a reſtraining power; yea, and if need be, the power to Correct, ſo that it reach not to Life, nor Limb; and doubtleſs <hi>Joſhua</hi> intended to put this power in Exerciſe, when he reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed, that he and his Houſe ſhould Serve the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 20.15. Yet alas! how many Governours of Families neglect this Duty. Some are debarr'd from it by their own guilt, being guilty of the ſame ſins they
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40419:181"/> ſhould reprove in others; this ſtops their Mouths, and makes them neglect their Duty. Theſe Men do more hurt by their Example, than ever they are like to do by their reproofs; their way is therefore firſt to caſt out the beam out of their own Eye, and then to ſeek to pluck out the Mote out of anothers. But I ſpeak chiefly to thoſe that ſeem to make ſome Conſcience of their Duty, for with thoſe I am likelieſt to prevail; and theſe alſo many of them are extremely negligent, and have need of a ſharp Reproof themſelves. Friends, do you verily believe, that ungodly Livers ſhall go to Hell, and being once there, are in an irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loſt Condition? And can you ſuffer ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, that are like to ſuffer the Torments of Eternal Fire, and hold your Tongues, and never give them warning of their Danger? What an uncharitable thing is this, that you will ſuffer thoſe that are in near Relation to you, perhaps, the Wife of your Boſom, or the Children of your own Bowels, to lye in ſuch a deſperate danger, and never warn them of it. If thou ſaweſt a Blind Man upon the brow of an Hill, ready to break his Neck; or a Mad Man ready to kill himſelf, thou wouldeſt call to the one, and warn him of the danger, and reſtrain the other if thou wert able; and wilt thou have Compaſſion on the Body, and no pity on the Soul? Shouldeſt thou ſee thy near Relations coming to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and mighteſt ſave their Lives for a few words ſpeaking, wouldeſt be ſo uncharitable
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40419:182"/> as to hold thy peace? were one of thy Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friends in Hell, and were there a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of their Delivery; wouldeſt thou not go, and ride, and ſpeak, and pray, (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this were the way) in their behalf, and for their ſake? And wilt thou let them quietly go on in that way, that certainly tends thither, and never ſhew them the danger they are in? A vicious Life, without Repentance, will as certainly lead to Hell, as God is God, and the Scriptures are the word of God; for no unclean thing ſhall ever enter Heaven, no dirty Dog ſhall tread upon that Pavement: Didſt thou certainly know that thy Wife, or Friend, or near Relation were in Hell, and yet there were hopes of their Recovery, if thou wouldſt be at ſome pains, or at ſome Coſt; what an uncharitable part would it be in thee, to let them lye for ever, and for ever in thoſe Infernal Flames, and not ſeek their eaſe; and wilt neglect it now when it may poſſibly be prevented. Were but thy Wife, or Child in <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Slavery, thou wouldeſt pray, and intreat, and more than this for their Liberty. What tender heart could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee another in raging Torments, yet this will be the Condition of thy boſome Friends, if un-regenerate. Doſt thou ſee the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil leading them Captive at his pleaſure, &amp; haſt thou nothing at all to ſay againſt it? It may be thou Prayeſt for their Converſion, and wilt not ſpeak a word to this purpoſe? What diſſembling is this, and what mocking of God?
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:40419:182"/> If there be a deſire, it will be joyned with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: Shouldeſt thou ſee thy Friend in a Pit, ready to be drowned, wouldſt thou fall upon thy knees, and Pray for help, and not put forth thy hand to help him? This would ſeem little Love: God will have means uſed to ſerve his Providence. It may be thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt troubling them; but 'tis a Fooliſh Phyſitian that ſuffers his Patient to dye under his hand, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than trouble him; in a Swoon we ſhaKe, and rub, and, pinch, and uſe other means, which, perhaps may hurt them. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are more Charitable in their blind Devotion, how dear do they pay for <hi>Maſſes, Dirges,</hi> &amp;c. for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of their Deceaſed Friends Souls out of their feigned Purgatory. But if your Charity to others be ſo cold, yet at leaſt be Charitable to thy ſelf, and bring not the blood of others Souls upon thy Account; the Sins which thou maiſt hinder, and doſt not, will be laid at thy Door, and the Blood of thoſe Souls that periſh through thy neglect, will be Charged upon thee; carefully therefore ſet upon this Duty.</p>

They are near, and dear to thee, part of thy ſelf, of thy Fleſh, and of thy Bones; did they not come out of thine own Bowels?

Oh! how neceſſary then is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in parents; for where the Blind leads the Blind, both falls into the Ditch: and what thoughts will you have at your meeting in Hell? Set therefore upon this Duty betimes before it be too late; Train them up when they are young, in the way they ſhould walk; that when they are old they may not decline it: Delays are dangerous, Life is ſhort, the time of Death is uncertain; the Heart grows harder, and Sin grows ſtronger, the Devil gets better hold, and ſurer poſſeſſion; every Day makes them more unfit than other for Repentance.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40419:185"/> Purified and Sincere Heart, and from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love to God, and are directed to a right End, his Glory continues with thy own happineſs; then are they like to be a pleaſing Sacrifice unto God: for where the Fountain is clear, the Streams will be good; but till the Heart be right, their proceedings will be defiled. Though Man Judge the Heart by the Actions, God Judgeth the Actions by the Heart; he is <hi>Hoker lebh, Scrutator cordes, the ſearcher of the Heart, and the tryer of the Reins, and gives every Man according to his ways, Jer.</hi> 17.9,10. The Heart is the Fountan of all the Thoughts, Words, and Actions; now if the Fountain be filthy, ſo are the Streams: Sweet Water, and bitter, cannot proceed out of the ſame hole; if an Apple be rotten at the Coare, it will not be long before the outſide rot alſo: If the Heart be rotten, it ſooner, or later breaks forth, and rots the Life, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation alſo; as it did in <hi>Saul, Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and many others. An inbred Diſtemper, will appear outwardly; and a Soar not ſound at the bottom, will Feſter, and break out at length: Sincerity is like a skilful <hi>Alchymiſt</hi> it turns all into Gold; weak performances, defective Duties, ſhall be accepted: a Sigh, a Groan, a Deſire ſhall be underſtood, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered But Hypocriſie on the contrary, turns Gold into Droſs, and Duties into Sin, and the moſt Glorious performance into abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; take heed therefore of this, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the other: Faith alſo is requiſite in all
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40419:185"/> thy Duties, leave not that behind thee in any Duty, if thou meaneſt to ſpeed; if Faith be abſent, God will not be preſent: without Faith 'is impoſſible to pleaſe him. No Prayer can pierce Heaven thar is not pointed by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. <hi>he that comes to God, muſt believe that God is; and that he is a rewarder of thoſe that dilligently ſeek him.</hi> The Word Preached will not prove it, if it be not mixed with Faith in thoſe that hear it; nay, without Faith there can be no Salvation, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>he that believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned, Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> Self-denyal alſo is requiſite; when thou haſt done all, ſay thou art an unprofitable Servant. God gives Grace to the Humble, but looks upon the Proud afar off; yea the Apoſtle ſaith, he reſiſteth the Proud, or ſets himſelf in Battel aray againſt him; bring not a proud heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with thee, if thou wouldeſt ſpeak with God in a Duty: ſubmit to his Will, though thou ſee not a reaſon for his Command, there is yet reaſon enough why thou ſhouldeſt obey, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: content thy ſelf to be at Gods diſpoſe, do thy Duty, and he will do his Work; but Limit him not to Time, Place, Manner, Meaſure, or other Circumſtances: depend upon him as <hi>Hannah</hi> did, when ſhe had prayed, ſhe looked no more ſad. Take heed when thou haſt done thy Work, of Heart-riſing Thoughts, or proud vain Glory; leſt it make thee loſe thy Reward: this will ſpoil thy Duty, and make thee loſe thy Reward:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40419:186"/> deny thy Self, and he will not deny thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: the lower thou thinkeſt of thy Duties, the better God thinks of them; and will Crown them with Succeſs. And having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun well, be ſure to hold out, be thou conſtant to the Death, and he will give thee a Crown of Life: what thou wanteſt, and beggeſt of God, endeavour with Heart and Hand to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: true Deſires are always accompanied with endeavours, 'tis not enough to wiſh for Heaven, but work for it: Corruption will not be abated, nor Grace increaſed, without pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: love Holineſs, and hate Sin, or thou wilt never hold out, or do good: <hi>if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Iniquity in thy Heart, God will not hear thy Prayer, Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31. God requires Holineſs, in all that draw near to him; and <hi>without it, no Man ſhall ſee him with Comfort, Heb.</hi> 12.14. If thou take this courſe in thy Publick and Private Duties, Peace ſhall be to thee, and to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Now to him that is able to keep you from falling, and to preſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his Glory, with exceeding Joy, to the only wiſe God our Saviour, be Glory, and Majeſty, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and Power, both now and ever <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
